Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.08,0:01:33.20,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因为这门课的教材是我们写的

Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.62,0:01:40.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,实际上我们是从 1998 年的 213 课程开始写这本书的
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.64,0:01:45.52,English,,0,0,0,,And I know that you are children and all that stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.64,0:01:45.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我知道当时你们都还是小孩子
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.54,0:01:55.60,English,,0,0,0,,But out of response for a new type of course that you'll see today that sort of gives people a in-depth understanding of systems
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.54,0:01:55.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,鉴于反馈，你们今天看到的新课程会让人们更好理解计算机系统
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.06,0:01:58.88,English,,0,0,0,,But more from a high level or programmers perspective
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.06,0:01:58.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不过是从更高的角度和程序员的视角
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.88,0:02:01.38,English,,0,0,0,,And we'll talk some about the philosophy of the course later
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.88,0:02:01.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,之后我们会谈到这门课的哲学
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.72,0:02:08.70,English,,0,0,0,,So this book as you see are just came out its third edition last March
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.72,0:02:08.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,正如你们所见这本书 3 月份才刚刚出本第三版（2015-03）
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.86,0:02:11.46,English,,0,0,0,,And that's the required text for the course
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.86,0:02:11.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这是这门课的必备教材
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.10,0:02:16.10,English,,0,0,0,,And there is nothing you can do to avoid buying that book
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.10,0:02:16.10,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你们无可避免都需要买这本书
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.76,0:02:18.40,English,,0,0,0,,And it's not because we're greedy
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.76,0:02:18.40,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不是因为我们贪财
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.90,0:02:27.08,English,,0,0,0,,I Actually we take the money we get from royalty for students in this course or any CMU course and we donate it to CMU
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.90,0:02:27.08,Chinese,,0,0,0,,实际上我们通过这门课或者其他 CMU 课程挣到的版税都捐给了 CMU
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.74,0:02:31.20,English,,0,0,0,,So we're not actually making any money out of you buying the book
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.74,0:02:31.20,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以我们没有通过学生购买教材挣到 1 分钱
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.22,0:02:37.00,English,,0,0,0,,But it's a simple reality that the new version is different than the old
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.22,0:02:37.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,话说回来新版本和旧版本有很大的不同
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.50,0:02:39.70,English,,0,0,0,,We expect you to be using the new version
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.50,0:02:39.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们希望你们使用新版本
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.28,0:02:44.88,English,,0,0,0,,There are no electronic copies,there are no pirated versions
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.28,0:02:44.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在还没有电子版，盗版
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.02,0:02:47.38,English,,0,0,0,,So you basically have to buy the book
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.02,0:02:47.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以你们必须买书
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.54,0:02:50.66,English,,0,0,0,,But I don't really apologize for that
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.54,0:02:50.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是我不准备向大家道歉
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.66,0:02:57.38,English,,0,0,0,,Because I know you or your parents who somebody's paying a lot of money for you to be here
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.66,0:02:57.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因为我知道你的父母或者其他什么人给了你们很多钱让你们来这里学习
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.50,0:03:01.56,English,,0,0,0,,So the price of the book is really a relatively small amount relative to that
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.50,0:03:01.56,Chinese,,0,0,0,,相比这下购买这本书是一笔非常小的花销
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.02,0:03:06.86,English,,0,0,0,,And this course by the way is not some courses serious
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.02,0:03:06.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,顺便说一下，这门课不像其它某些十分严肃的课
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.20,0:03:12.76,English,,0,0,0,,Oh yeah this book you might want to look at it once in a while but actually the course has nothing to do with that
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.20,0:03:12.76,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你可能时不时会想看这本书，但是实际上课程与这本书没什么关系
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.16,0:03:18.36,English,,0,0,0,,This course,the book and the course are one,they're very tied together
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.16,0:03:18.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这门课和这本书是一个整体，非常紧密的联系在一起
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.36,0:03:26.10,English,,0,0,0,,There'll be parts of the book that we don't go into all the details that are in the book sometimes
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.36,0:03:26.10,Chinese,,0,0,0,,有时我们并不能在上课是讲到书里面的所有细节
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.12,0:03:27.98,English,,0,0,0,,But we expect you to be able to figure it out
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.12,0:03:27.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是我们希望你们能自己能弄明白
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.80,0:03:33.90,English,,0,0,0,,And so really the course in the book are tied together
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.80,0:03:33.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这门课和这本书紧密的联系在一起
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.90,0:03:37.82,English,,0,0,0,,And they were very much the progress of the course the topics covered
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.90,0:03:37.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,紧跟课程的进展涵盖了所有主题
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.24,0:03:44.22,English,,0,0,0,,How it's covered everything about it is consistent with the book
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.24,0:03:44.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,和怎么涵盖的所有内容都包含在这本书当中了
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.24,0:03:49.32,English,,0,0,0,,We wrote the book because of the course think of them as course notes
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.24,0:03:49.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们写这本书的原因是拿这本书当作课程笔记
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.96,0:03:54.32,English,,0,0,0,,So and the reason why we are teaching this term by the way
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.96,0:03:54.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个学期我们使用这种方式教授这门课的原因是
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.32,0:03:59.30,English,,0,0,0,,We have't taught together in several years,but because this is the first roll out of this book
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.32,0:03:59.30,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们好几年没有一起授课了，但是因为这次是这本书第一次推出到市场
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.96,0:04:06.40,English,,0,0,0,,And not only is it being used here but it's actually used by about 250 schools around the world
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.96,0:04:06.40,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这本书不仅在这里被使用，全世界接近 250 所学校也在使用这本教材
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.94,0:04:16.76,English,,0,0,0,,And many of those people are also going through the same activities of teaching from this new edition for the first time
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.94,0:04:16.76,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这里面很多人都是第一次使用新版本的教材来进行和我们相同的教学活动
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.18,0:04:21.90,English,,0,0,0,,And so we wanted to make sure all the material for the course was a sort of put in order and things
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.18,0:04:21.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因此我们要确保这门课所有的内容都是有序的
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.44,0:04:30.04,English,,0,0,0,,Because other universities and other colleges use this material...this supporting material we've developed
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.44,0:04:30.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因为有其他大学或学院使用我们开发的教学材料
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.84,0:04:37.52,English,,0,0,0,,So that's the course and today is the first election we're sort of doing a tag team here
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.84,0:04:37.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,今天是这门课的第一节课，我将会介绍一下教学团队
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.52,0:04:41.94,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah I'll talk the high level what the course is about what the main themes are
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.52,0:04:41.94,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这门课我会教授主要的章节
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.52,0:04:45.24,English,,0,0,0,,And Dave will talk more about the logistics
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.52,0:04:45.24,Chinese,,0,0,0,,Dave 更多的讲授逻辑的部分
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.40,0:04:52.12,English,,0,0,0,,So we refer the the thing we have that
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.40,0:04:52.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,课程内容参考我们的所见所知
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.14,0:05:01.84,English,,0,0,0,,When the very first time I typed the number of this course into a text editor
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.14,0:05:01.84,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当我第一次在文本编辑器中输入这门课的编号时
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.86,0:05:06.02,English,,0,0,0,,I realized I've typed those five digits many times in my career
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.86,0:05:06.02,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我就已经意识到我将会在我的职业生涯中输入这五个数字很多次
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.02,0:05:10.20,English,,0,0,0,,Because it's the zip code of CMU, 15213
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.02,0:05:10.20,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因为 15213 是 CMU 的邮政编码
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.28,0:05:12.48,English,,0,0,0,,So that's where we come up with the same
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.28,0:05:12.48,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因此我们从相同的地方开始
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.08,0:05:26.18,English,,0,0,0,,So there's a few things about this course for the most part you know in your normal undergraduate curriculum
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.08,0:05:26.18,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以这门课有一些内容你们大多数人在本科课程中都曾接触到
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.32,0:05:31.74,English,,0,0,0,,When you've learned programming,you've been very much separated from the realities of the machine
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.32,0:05:31.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你们已经学会了编程，但是你们和计算机的本质相隔甚远
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.78,0:05:38.88,English,,0,0,0,,You just think about code just you put some text into some little box
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.78,0:05:38.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你们只认为编程是把文本放入一个小盒子里
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.10,0:05:46.62,English,,0,0,0,,Somehow, and outcomes of behavior that it hopefully is what you intended the program to do
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.10,0:05:46.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不知道为什么，产生的结果和行为是你们希望程序做的
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.06,0:05:54.04,English,,0,0,0,,The purpose of this course is to give you enough understanding of what that box is doing when it executes your code
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.06,0:05:54.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这门课的目的是让你深入了解当在执行你的代码时「盒子」在做什么
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.64,0:06:00.82,English,,0,0,0,,And through that to help you become better at what you're trying to do
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.64,0:06:00.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,通过这些来帮助你在你想做的事情上做得更好
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.70,0:06:07.52,English,,0,0,0,,So some of the outcomes is there's really two types of outcomes from this course
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.70,0:06:07.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这样会产生两种结果
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.54,0:06:12.02,English,,0,0,0,,One is that if this is the only systems course you ever take in your whole life
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.54,0:06:12.02,Chinese,,0,0,0,,一种是，如果这是你一生中唯一的系统课程
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.36,0:06:17.94,English,,0,0,0,,You will get useful material from it,you will learn tools,tricks,methods
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.36,0:06:17.94,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你将获得有用的东西，了解工具、技巧和方法
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.38,0:06:23.20,English,,0,0,0,,That will help you if you ever are in involved in software development
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.38,0:06:23.20,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如果你们曾经参与过软件开发
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.46,0:06:32.20,English,,0,0,0,,large-scale software engineering projects,systems hardware design any aspect of computer technology
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.46,0:06:32.20,Chinese,,0,0,0,,大规模的软件工程项目、系统硬件设计或计算机技术的任何方面
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.20,0:06:35.14,English,,0,0,0,,This will help you be better at what you do
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.20,0:06:35.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它会帮助你们做的更好
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.58,0:06:41.08,English,,0,0,0,,You'll understand what programs do how they work,what the machines that support them do
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.58,0:06:41.08,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你们会明白程序是如何运行的，机器是如何支持程序运行的
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.30,0:06:45.26,English,,0,0,0,,Why sometimes they work really well and why sometimes they don't work so well
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.30,0:06:45.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,会明白为什么有时程序可以正常运行有时却不能
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.94,0:06:54.14,English,,0,0,0,,It also is intended as it's sort of stepping stone into a whole number of other courses at CMU

Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.00,0:07:01.80,English,,0,0,0,,But our sort of specialized by topical area
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.00,0:07:01.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是我们专注于一些与主题有关的方面
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.34,0:07:07.60,English,,0,0,0,,Whether it's computer networking or operating systems or embedded systems
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.34,0:07:07.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,比如计算机网络、操作系统、嵌入式系统
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.50,0:07:16.90,English,,0,0,0,,Where you'll take the sort of ideas from this course and be able to then learn in a somewhat narrower but deeper sense what's really going on
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.50,0:07:16.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你会从这门课上学到一些概念然后能够学习更局限但是更深层次的运行规律
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.60,0:07:26.04,English,,0,0,0,,And so it really is trying to serve those two goals of making you more effective giving you useful ideas and tools right away
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.60,0:07:26.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们致力于实现这两个目标，让你更有效率，给你十分有用的想法和工具
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.32,0:07:29.58,English,,0,0,0,,But also preparing you for later courses
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.32,0:07:29.58,Chinese,,0,0,0,,并且让你做好学习后续有关的课程的准备
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.82,0:07:36.56,English,,0,0,0,,So when we talked about this is sort of what's why what kind of stuff will you learn from this course
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.82,0:07:36.56,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以提到你能从这个课程学到什么东西和为什么要学这门课
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.10,0:07:44.74,English,,0,0,0,,It is to go through a series of what we call great realities places where sort of computers meet up
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.10,0:07:44.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它将经历一系列我们称之为伟大现实的地方，在那里，各种各样的计算机相遇
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.18,0:07:49.96,English,,0,0,0,,real-life computers get meet up against your expectations and maybe they're not quite the same
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.18,0:07:49.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现实生活中的电脑和你们所期望的或许不是完全相同
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.46,0:07:57.44,English,,0,0,0,,so one of them is and the first part of the course is going to take a fairly detailed look how numbers are represented in computers
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.46,0:07:57.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,其中一种就是在课程的第一部分中仔细观察数字在计算机中怎么表示的
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.92,0:08:04.96,English,,0,0,0,,And you'll learn some things that are on one hand surprising and another hand will start to make sense when you understand it better
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.92,0:08:04.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,一方面你会在学习过程中感到惊讶，另一方面当你们理解之后又会觉得精巧
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.60,0:08:11.36,English,,0,0,0,,So a simple case is for numbers
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.60,0:08:11.36,Chinese,,0,0,0,,一个简单的例子就是数字
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.18,0:08:18.04,English,,0,0,0,,I don't know when it was but it was probably in about eighth grade algebra that I learned that
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.18,0:08:18.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我不知道是什么时候，大概是在八年级的代数课上我学到
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.50,0:08:23.52,English,,0,0,0,,If you square a number it will be at least zero  if it's not an imaginary number
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.50,0:08:23.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如果你计算一个数的平方，只要它不是虚数，那么结果至少是 0
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.74,0:08:33.22,English,,0,0,0,,So an integer or a real number you'd expect to square it and it to be a positive value or perhaps zero right?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.74,0:08:33.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以对于一个整数或实数，它的平方你会认为结果是一个非负数，对吗？
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.28,0:08:39.70,English,,0,0,0,,And that's actually generally true with floats a representation of floating-point number
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.28,0:08:39.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,大多数情况下对于 float 类型所表示的浮点数会得到正确的结果
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.48,0:08:49.22,English,,0,0,0,,But with integers or int you know the computer representation of integers it's not so clear
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.48,0:08:49.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是对于整数或者 int 类型（计算机中的整数类型）就不是很清楚了
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.64,0:08:59.08,English,,0,0,0,,So for example if you square 40,000 on most computers then you'll get whatever that should be as you'd expect
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.64,0:08:59.08,Chinese,,0,0,0,,举个例子，如果你们计算 40,000 的平方，大部分的计算机会给出你们想要的结果
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.96,0:09:02.00,English,,0,0,0,,But what if you square 50000?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.96,0:09:02.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是 50,000 的平方是多少呢？
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.50,0:09:09.40,English,,0,0,0,,So you could do this in your head,but I actually built into this laptop computer
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.50,0:09:09.40,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你们可以在你们的脑海中算一下，但实际上我算数都靠这台笔记本电脑
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.52,0:09:12.66,English,,0,0,0,,So I'm going to go ahead and use it
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.52,0:09:12.66,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以我要用它
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.98,0:09:16.78,English,,0,0,0,,Emm...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.98,0:09:16.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,额...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.78,0:09:31.06,English,,0,0,0,,And use a tool which on UNIX systems is called...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.78,0:09:31.06,Chinese,,0,0,0,,使用的工具在 UNIX 系统中叫做
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.84,0:09:52.40,English,,0,0,0,,Linux systems is called GDB,but on Macintosh OS X it's called LLDB
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.84,0:09:52.40,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在 Linux 系统中是叫做 GDB，在 Macintosh OS 上被叫做 LLDB
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.40,0:09:53.80,English,,0,0,0,,But they're pretty much the same program
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.40,0:09:53.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是它们是几乎一样的程序
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.20,0:09:57.40,English,,0,0,0,,You will get to know this program really really well this term
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.20,0:09:57.40,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在这个学期你们会很好的掌握这个程序
Dialogue: 0,0:09:58.22,0:10:02.56,English,,0,0,0,,So like I said a few square 40,000
Dialogue: 0,0:09:58.22,0:10:02.56,Chinese,,0,0,0,,像我说的 40,000 的平方
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.16,0:10:04.28,English,,0,0,0,,You get...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.16,0:10:04.28,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你会获得...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.36,0:10:07.86,English,,0,0,0,,What you'd expect?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.36,0:10:07.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你们期望是什么？
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.38,0:10:14.18,English,,0,0,0,,But let's change this to 50,000
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.38,0:10:14.18,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是把这个数改成 50,000
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.50,0:10:23.60,English,,0,0,0,,And you get a very peculiar number that doesn't look anything like you'd expect 50,000 squared to be
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.50,0:10:23.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你会看到一个很奇怪的数字，它看起来和你所期待的 50,000 平方的结果大相径庭
Dialogue: 0,0:10:23.60,0:10:24.98,English,,0,0,0,,And in fact it's negative
Dialogue: 0,0:10:23.60,0:10:24.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,事实上它是一个负数
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.96,0:10:30.96,English,,0,0,0,,And so that might just seem like well there must be a mistake or something
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.96,0:10:30.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,看起来程序好像出错了
Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.98,0:10:39.58,English,,0,0,0,,No that's just the way it is.Because this computer is expecting numbers to be represented as 32-bit values
Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.98,0:10:39.58,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不，就是这样。因为这台计算机期望数字是 32-bit (32 位) 的值
Dialogue: 0,0:10:40.28,0:10:48.90,English,,0,0,0,,And the bit pattern that you get when you do this multiplication happens to be the representation of a negative number
Dialogue: 0,0:10:40.28,0:10:48.90,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当你做完乘法运算后的得到值的位的格式恰好是一个负数的格式
Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.14,0:10:56.62,English,,0,0,0,,So that's a an example of where your normal expectations about integer arithmetic may or may not hold
Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.14,0:10:56.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这是个例子说明你对整数运算的正常期望可能成立，也可能不成立
Dialogue: 0,0:10:57.30,0:11:01.58,English,,0,0,0,,On the other hand...there are some places...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:57.30,0:11:01.58,Chinese,,0,0,0,,另外在其他的例子里
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.08,0:11:15.02,English,,0,0,0,,If I try to do the same thing 300*400*500*600
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.08,0:11:15.02,Chinese,,0,0,0,,比如我计算 300*400*500*600
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.02,0:11:19.10,English,,0,0,0,,Then all of a sudden I also get a number that clearly is not what you'd expect
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.02,0:11:19.10,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后我突然得出一个结果，这显然不是你们期望的
Dialogue: 0,0:11:19.10,0:11:20.82,English,,0,0,0,,Because the same thing has happened
Dialogue: 0,0:11:19.10,0:11:20.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因为发生了同样的事情
Dialogue: 0,0:11:21.22,0:11:26.38,English,,0,0,0,,I've gotten an overflow it happens that it's overflowed to a value that's positive not negative
Dialogue: 0,0:11:21.22,0:11:26.38,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我计算的结果溢出了。当发生溢出时值可能变成整数或者负数
Dialogue: 0,0:11:26.40,0:11:30.96,English,,0,0,0,,But it still is obviously not the integer product of those four numbers
Dialogue: 0,0:11:26.40,0:11:30.96,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但它显然不是这四个数的整数乘积
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.94,0:11:42.80,English,,0,0,0,,On the other hand one thing you'll find is even though this arithmetic is not a normal sort of integer arithmetic
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.94,0:11:42.80,Chinese,,0,0,0,,另一方面，你会发现尽管这个运算不是一种合理的整数运算
Dialogue: 0,0:11:43.90,0:11:47.56,English,,0,0,0,,It actually has some well-behaved properties
Dialogue: 0,0:11:43.90,0:11:47.56,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它实际上有一些表现良好的性质
Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.00,0:11:50.30,English,,0,0,0,,So for example if you look at...
Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.00,0:11:50.30,Chinese,,0,0,0,,举个例子，如果你注意到
Dialogue: 0,0:11:53.96,0:11:59.72,English,,0,0,0,,What I've done is I just moved the 300 around from the beginning of the product to the end of the product
Dialogue: 0,0:11:53.96,0:11:59.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我把 300 从算式的前面移到算式的后面
Dialogue: 0,0:12:00.46,0:12:04.30,English,,0,0,0,,So now if you think about how associativity and commutativity works
Dialogue: 0,0:12:00.46,0:12:04.30,Chinese,,0,0,0,,现在，如果你们想一下结合律和交换律是如何起作用的
Dialogue: 0,0:12:04.90,0:12:07.92,English,,0,0,0,,I'm basically multiplying these four numbers in a different order
Dialogue: 0,0:12:04.90,0:12:07.92,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我仅仅把这四个数字以不同顺序相乘
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.64,0:12:14.44,English,,0,0,0,,But what you see is you get the same funny-looking result no matter how you do it
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.64,0:12:14.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是无论你做什么你都会得到相同的看起来很滑稽的结果
Dialogue: 0,0:12:14.48,0:12:18.72,English,,0,0,0,,So what you can say from this is integer arithmetic is commutative and associative
Dialogue: 0,0:12:14.48,0:12:18.72,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以你可以说，整数运算符合交换律和结合律
Dialogue: 0,0:12:18.80,0:12:22.50,English,,0,0,0,,So it obeys some of the conventional mathematical properties
Dialogue: 0,0:12:18.80,0:12:22.50,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它符合一些常规的运算性质
Dialogue: 0,0:12:22.86,0:12:25.78,English,,0,0,0,,It just isn't what you'd expect it to be
Dialogue: 0,0:12:22.86,0:12:25.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,并不是像你期待的那样
Dialogue: 0,0:12:25.78,0:12:36.00,English,,0,0,0,,It's not a normal sort of mathematical integer arithmetic
Dialogue: 0,0:12:25.78,0:12:36.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这不是一种正常的整数运算
Dialogue: 0,0:12:36.56,0:12:50.83,English,,0,0,0,,So the cartoon here shows an example that's a similar possibility.We get to it
Dialogue: 0,0:12:36.56,0:12:50.83,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这里漫画所展示的情况和现在很类似
Dialogue: 0,0:12:58.50,0:13:00.42,English,,0,0,0,,Oh I guess it comes at the end
Dialogue: 0,0:12:58.50,0:13:00.42,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我想应该在最后
Dialogue: 0,0:13:01.26,0:13:08.88,English,,0,0,0,,So then the next question is is a addition associative right can you order the numbers
Dialogue: 0,0:13:01.26,0:13:08.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,下一个问题是它符合加法结合律吗，你能改变顺序后再运算吗？
Dialogue: 0,0:13:09.20,0:13:15.52,English,,0,0,0,,And as you probably might have figured both in the integer arithmetic, even though as this potential for overflow
Dialogue: 0,0:13:09.20,0:13:15.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你可能在整数运算中计算过了，尽管（乘法和加法）两种运算都有溢出风险
Dialogue: 0,0:13:16.00,0:13:19.16,English,,0,0,0,,It is associative and it's commutative too
Dialogue: 0,0:13:16.00,0:13:19.16,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它们都符合交换律和结合律
Dialogue: 0,0:13:19.82,0:13:22.44,English,,0,0,0,,But for floats it's not really quite the same
Dialogue: 0,0:13:19.82,0:13:22.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是浮点数就不一样了
Dialogue: 0,0:13:23.48,0:13:30.92,English,,0,0,0,,Because the range of values you can get in floating pointers so extreme that some numbers kind of disappear on you
Dialogue: 0,0:13:23.48,0:13:30.92,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因为浮点数的取值范围是如此的极端以至于有些数字会消失
Dialogue: 0,0:13:30.94,0:13:35.34,English,,0,0,0,,So the example I'll show without having to use a computer to do it
Dialogue: 0,0:13:30.94,0:13:35.34,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这个例子我不需要用电脑来做
Dialogue: 0,0:13:35.74,0:13:39.12,English,,0,0,0,,If you take a big number and subtract it from itself
Dialogue: 0,0:13:35.74,0:13:39.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如果你取一个大的数，然后减去它本身
Dialogue: 0,0:13:39.74,0:13:40.44,English,,0,0,0,,You'll get zero
Dialogue: 0,0:13:39.74,0:13:40.44,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你会得到 0
Dialogue: 0,0:13:40.60,0:13:44.78,English,,0,0,0,,So if you add that to 3.14 you'll get 3.14
Dialogue: 0,0:13:40.60,0:13:44.78,Chinese,,0,0,0,,如果你再加上 3.14 你会得到 3.14
Dialogue: 0,0:13:45.72,0:13:52.82,English,,0,0,0,,But if you take those two numbers and you reorder the how you combine them
Dialogue: 0,0:13:45.72,0:13:52.82,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是你把两个数改变顺序并计算
Dialogue: 0,0:13:53.04,0:13:59.18,English,,0,0,0,,So that 3.14 compared to -1e20 is so insignificant
Dialogue: 0,0:13:53.04,0:13:59.18,Chinese,,0,0,0,,和 -1e20 大小相比 3.14 就显得微不足道了
Dialogue: 0,0:13:59.18,0:14:04.30,English,,0,0,0,,That that result gets turned into -1e20
Dialogue: 0,0:13:59.18,0:14:04.30,Chinese,,0,0,0,,结果是 -1e20（-1 后面 20 个 0）
Dialogue: 0,0:14:04.70,0:14:10.04,English,,0,0,0,,And you add that to 1e20 and you end up with zero.So it's not associative
Dialogue: 0,0:14:04.70,0:14:10.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后加上 1e20 你会得到 0。这不符合结合律
Dialogue: 0,0:14:10.56,0:14:18.62,English,,0,0,0,,And so what you see is the both these number systems have some peculiarities
Dialogue: 0,0:14:10.56,0:14:18.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以你看出这两种数系都有一些古怪
Dialogue: 0,0:14:18.64,0:14:26.08,English,,0,0,0,,And it all comes down to the fact that they use finite representations of things that are potentially infinite in their expanse
Dialogue: 0,0:14:18.64,0:14:26.08,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这一切都归结为一个事实，他们用有限的位组合形式表示在数域中无限扩张的数
Dialogue: 0,0:14:26.68,0:14:30.10,English,,0,0,0,,So there's some compromises in how those work
Dialogue: 0,0:14:26.68,0:14:30.10,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以在如何实现功能上有一些妥协
Dialogue: 0,0:14:30.58,0:14:36.10,English,,0,0,0,,And what the compromise is you can overflow an integer and run out of room
Dialogue: 0,0:14:30.58,0:14:36.10,Chinese,,0,0,0,,折衷的办法是你可以溢出一个整数然后耗尽空间
Dialogue: 0,0:14:36.54,0:14:42.56,English,,0,0,0,,And in floating point numbers you have roundoff problems where you sort of drop the digits that aren't significant
Dialogue: 0,0:14:36.54,0:14:42.56,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而在浮点数字中，你有舍入问题，你可能会丢掉不重要的数字
Dialogue: 0,0:14:42.78,0:14:46.68,English,,0,0,0,,You can also overflow floating point but the more common problem is roundoff
Dialogue: 0,0:14:42.78,0:14:46.68,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你同样也可以使浮点符号溢出，但更常见的问题是舍入
Dialogue: 0,0:14:48.98,0:14:54.04,English,,0,0,0,,So this is shown in this cartoon this idea of overflow of somebody counting sheep
Dialogue: 0,0:14:48.98,0:14:54.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以这个动画片显示了这个有人算羊的溢出的想法
Dialogue: 0,0:14:54.72,0:14:59.02,English,,0,0,0,,Which in the U.S. is in English language at least a way to fall asleep
Dialogue: 0,0:14:54.72,0:14:59.02,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在美国用英语来说至少是一种入睡的方式
Dialogue: 0,0:14:59.68,0:15:05.02,English,,0,0,0,,And when he or she goes from 32,767
Dialogue: 0,0:14:59.68,0:15:05.02,Chinese,,0,0,0,,当他或她从 32,767 起
Dialogue: 0,0:15:05.48,0:15:10.52,English,,0,0,0,,And then increment set by one gets -32,768
Dialogue: 0,0:15:05.48,0:15:10.52,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后增加一得到 -32,768
Dialogue: 0,0:15:10.92,0:15:18.18,English,,0,0,0,,And we'll see exactly why that happens but basically the numbers are going  up to the larger value can represent
Dialogue: 0,0:15:10.92,0:15:18.18,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们将看到为什么会发生这种情况，当这些数字会上升到能表示的极限最大值后
Dialogue: 0,0:15:18.18,0:15:20.50,English,,0,0,0,,And then when it goes one more it becomes a negative number

Dialogue: 0,0:26:43.48,0:26:52.32,English,,0,0,0,,So something fishy is going on if the same program that differs only in this seemingly insignificant way
Dialogue: 0,0:26:43.48,0:26:52.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,仅有这种看似不痛不痒的区别，两个完全相同的程序，运行起来却发生了相当诡异的事情
Dialogue: 0,0:26:52.34,0:26:57.88,English,,0,0,0,,A way that has no effect whatsoever on its functionality can have this much performance difference
Dialogue: 0,0:26:52.34,0:26:57.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,一种对其功能没有任何影响的修改，可以产生这么大的性能差异
Dialogue: 0,0:26:58.62,0:27:03.14,English,,0,0,0,,And so to understand this you need to stare at the cover of the book
Dialogue: 0,0:26:58.62,0:27:03.14,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以要了解这一点，你需要盯着书的封面
Dialogue: 0,0:27:07.74,0:27:16.00,English,,0,0,0,,Because basically you're two different points of this strange-looking picture that's on your book
Dialogue: 0,0:27:07.74,0:27:16.00,Chinese,,0,0,0,,因为基本上你是在书上这张奇怪图片的两个不同点
Dialogue: 0,0:27:16.04,0:27:20.12,English,,0,0,0,,And since there's no axis or labels on it it makes no sense whatsoever
Dialogue: 0,0:27:16.04,0:27:20.12,Chinese,,0,0,0,,由于封面图没有轴或单位，所以它没有任何意义
Dialogue: 0,0:27:20.76,0:27:21.74,English,,0,0,0,,But it's there
Dialogue: 0,0:27:20.76,0:27:21.74,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但它在那里
Dialogue: 0,0:27:23.06,0:27:28.60,English,,0,0,0,,So what you see is this picture shows four different memory access patterns I won't go into the details
Dialogue: 0,0:27:23.06,0:27:28.60,Chinese,,0,0,0,,你看到的是这张图片显示了四种不同的内存访问模式，我在这里不会详细讨论
Dialogue: 0,0:27:29.42,0:27:37.86,English,,0,0,0,,What the throughput measured in megabytes per second on basically a copying program was
Dialogue: 0,0:27:29.42,0:27:37.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,基本上复制程序的吞吐量是以兆字节/秒为单位的
Dialogue: 0,0:27:38.70,0:27:41.46,English,,0,0,0,,And without going into the details what you'll see is
Dialogue: 0,0:27:38.70,0:27:41.46,Chinese,,0,0,0,,不深入细节，你看到的是
Dialogue: 0,0:27:41.86,0:27:46.42,English,,0,0,0,,These two functions sort of sit at different points in this memory access pattern
Dialogue: 0,0:27:41.86,0:27:46.42,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这两个函数在这个内存访问模式中位于不同的位置
Dialogue: 0,0:27:46.84,0:27:52.04,English,,0,0,0,,The one that goes through a row by row is much better than the one that goes through column by column
Dialogue: 0,0:27:46.84,0:27:52.04,Chinese,,0,0,0,,一行接一行方法比一列接一列的访问方法要好得多
Dialogue: 0,0:27:53.94,0:28:00.62,English,,0,0,0,,And as a result you're getting a lot better performance and it has to do with this memory hierarchy and what they call the cache memories
Dialogue: 0,0:27:53.94,0:28:00.62,Chinese,,0,0,0,,结果是，你获得了更好的性能，它和内存层次结构中的缓存有关
Dialogue: 0,0:28:01.22,0:28:06.40,English,,0,0,0,,That you're getting way better performance out of it in one case than the other
Dialogue: 0,0:28:01.22,0:28:06.40,Chinese,,0,0,0,,在某种情况下你获得了比其他方式性能高得多的方法
Dialogue: 0,0:28:06.72,0:28:11.56,English,,0,0,0,,So that's explains what the cover of the book is about
Dialogue: 0,0:28:06.72,0:28:11.56,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以这就解释了本书封面的内容
Dialogue: 0,0:28:11.82,0:28:13.88,English,,0,0,0,,We'll talk about it more later in the course
Dialogue: 0,0:28:11.82,0:28:13.88,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们稍后会在课程中深入讨论它
Dialogue: 0,0:28:15.40,0:28:21.76,English,,0,0,0,,And then a final part of the course talks more about not just getting computers to run little programs in isolation
Dialogue: 0,0:28:15.40,0:28:21.76,Chinese,,0,0,0,,然后，课程的最后一部分将更多地讨论不仅让计算机孤立运行小程序
Dialogue: 0,0:28:21.76,0:28:28.76,English,,0,0,0,,But getting computers that talk to each other over networks implement services like web servers
Dialogue: 0,0:28:21.76,0:28:28.76,Chinese,,0,0,0,,而且能够通过网络获取彼此交谈，实现像 Web 服务器这样的服务

Dialogue: 0,0:28:34.96,0:28:41.26,English,,0,0,0,,It's not just isolated machines but computers they internet with each other over the networks
Dialogue: 0,0:28:34.96,0:28:41.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它不仅仅是孤立的机器，而是通过网络彼此互联的计算机
Dialogue: 0,0:28:41.26,0:28:45.92,English,,0,0,0,,They're embedded controllers that are interacting with the physical world
Dialogue: 0,0:28:41.26,0:28:45.92,Chinese,,0,0,0,,它们是与物理世界交互的嵌入式控制器
Dialogue: 0,0:28:45.92,0:28:50.16,English,,0,0,0,,So really the the world of computers is a much richer environment
Dialogue: 0,0:28:45.92,0:28:50.16,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以电脑世界真的是一个更加丰富的环境
Dialogue: 0,0:28:50.42,0:28:54.26,English,,0,0,0,,And we'll cover at least some aspects of that in the final part of this course
Dialogue: 0,0:28:50.42,0:28:54.26,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们将在本课程的最后部分稍微介绍一点那些方面
Dialogue: 0,0:28:58.22,0:29:02.22,English,,0,0,0,,So as I mentioned the other feature of this course
Dialogue: 0,0:28:58.22,0:29:02.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以我提到了这门课的另一个特点

Dialogue: 0,0:29:19.08,0:29:23.18,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是你会看到这是一系列不同的课程
Dialogue: 0,0:29:23.72,0:29:31.22,English,,0,0,0,,And each of them builds on to one or multiple aspects of the material you learn in the course
Dialogue: 0,0:29:23.72,0:29:31.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,并且它们每一个都基于你在课程中学习的内容的一个或多个方面
Dialogue: 0,0:29:31.88,0:29:37.70,English,,0,0,0,,So the reason why we make everyone take this course including incoming master's students
Dialogue: 0,0:29:31.88,0:29:37.70,Chinese,,0,0,0,,所以这就是我们为什么要让每个人都参加这门课程，包括刚入学的硕士生
Dialogue: 0,0:29:38.28,0:29:44.70,English,,0,0,0,,It's that all these other courses at the university have come to rely on students being familiar
