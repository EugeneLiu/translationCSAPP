Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.02,0:03:06.86,English,,0,0,0,,And this course by the way is not some courses serious
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.02,0:03:06.86,Chinese,,0,0,0,,这门可以也不像其他课程那样严重

Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.36,0:03:26.10,English,,0,0,0,,There'll be parts of the book that we don't go into all the details that are in the book sometimes
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.36,0:03:26.10,Chinese,,0,0,0,,有时我们并不能在上课是讲到书里面的所有细节
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.12,0:03:27.98,English,,0,0,0,,But we expect you to be able to figure it out
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.12,0:03:27.98,Chinese,,0,0,0,,但是我们希望你们能自己能弄明白

Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.24,0:03:44.22,Chinese,,0,0,0,,课程中涵盖的所有内容都包含在这本书当中了
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.24,0:03:49.32,English,,0,0,0,,We wrote the book because of the course think of them as course notes
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.24,0:03:49.32,Chinese,,0,0,0,,我们写这本书的原因是那这本书当作课程笔记
