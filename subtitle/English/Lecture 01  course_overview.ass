Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.00,0:00:01.04,English,,0,0,0,,Hello everyone
Dialogue: 0,0:00:01.98,0:00:07.46,English,,0,0,0,,I'd like to welcome you all to this fall's this terms instance of
Dialogue: 0,0:00:07.82,0:00:17.06,English,,0,0,0,,This course is officially either 15-213 from computer science or 18-213 from electrical and computer engineering
Dialogue: 0,0:00:17.58,0:00:24.40,English,,0,0,0,,But a large number of people enrolled in this course 15-513 which is for graduate students
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.86,0:00:28.58,English,,0,0,0,,And to be totally honest you're not supposed to be here
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.58,0:00:33.28,English,,0,0,0,,Because you're supposed to watch the videos,the lectures by video later
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.70,0:00:37.46,English,,0,0,0,,But we're not checking any cards, so I don't really know who you are
Dialogue: 0,0:00:38.70,0:00:44.06,English,,0,0,0,,Anyways this course is as you can see a very popular course on campus
Dialogue: 0,0:00:44.06,0:00:46.36,English,,0,0,0,,We  are over 700. 700?
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.86,0:00:53.82,English,,0,0,0,,600 shouldn't exaggerate students on campus enrolled in one of those three versions of the course
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.52,0:01:04.38,English,,0,0,0,,Which if you think about a university of the size of CMU,that's like about 5% of total student population
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.06,0:01:10.36,English,,0,0,0,,So we're very glad to have you here
Dialogue: 0,0:01:13.98,0:01:18.16,English,,0,0,0,,I should let it begin.Try that it's better
Dialogue: 0,0:01:20.42,0:01:21.78,English,,0,0,0,,My name is Randal E.Bryant
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.66,0:01:24.96,English,,0,0,0,,And my co-instructor is Dave O'Hallaron
Dialogue: 0,0:01:24.96,0:01:28.96,English,,0,0,0,,And those names might be familiar if you have been in bookstore
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.08,0:01:33.20,English,,0,0,0,,Because the book was written by us
Dialogue: 0,0:01:33.62,0:01:40.78,English,,0,0,0,,We actually wrote this book we started 213 as a course in 1998
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.64,0:01:45.52,English,,0,0,0,,I know that you are children and all that stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.54,0:01:55.60,English,,0,0,0,,But out of response for a new type of course that you'll see today that sort of giving people a in-depth understanding of systems
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.06,0:01:58.88,English,,0,0,0,,But more from a high level or programmers perspective
Dialogue: 0,0:01:58.88,0:02:01.38,English,,0,0,0,,And we'll talk some about the philosophy of the course later
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.72,0:02:08.28,English,,0,0,0,,So this book as you see just came out its third edition last March
Dialogue: 0,0:02:08.86,0:02:11.46,English,,0,0,0,,And that's the required text for the course
Dialogue: 0,0:02:12.10,0:02:16.10,English,,0,0,0,,And there is nothing you can do to avoid buying that book
Dialogue: 0,0:02:16.76,0:02:18.40,English,,0,0,0,,And it's not because we're greedy
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.90,0:02:27.08,English,,0,0,0,,Actually we take the money we get from royalty for students in this course or any CMU course and we donate it to CMU
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.74,0:02:31.20,English,,0,0,0,,So we're not actually making any money out of you buying the book
Dialogue: 0,0:02:31.22,0:02:37.00,English,,0,0,0,,But it's a simple reality that the new version is different than the old
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.50,0:02:39.70,English,,0,0,0,,We expect you to be using the new version
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.28,0:02:44.88,English,,0,0,0,,There are no electronic copies,there are no pirated versions
Dialogue: 0,0:02:45.02,0:02:47.38,English,,0,0,0,,So you basically have to buy the book
Dialogue: 0,0:02:47.54,0:02:50.66,English,,0,0,0,,But I don't really apologize for that
Dialogue: 0,0:02:50.66,0:02:57.38,English,,0,0,0,,Because I know you or your parents who somebody's paying a lot of money for you to be here
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.50,0:03:01.56,English,,0,0,0,,So the price of the book is really a relatively small amount relative to that
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.02,0:03:06.86,English,,0,0,0,,And this course by the way is not some courses serious
Dialogue: 0,0:03:07.20,0:03:12.76,English,,0,0,0,,Oh yeah this book you might want to look at it once in a while but actually the course has nothing to do that
Dialogue: 0,0:03:13.16,0:03:18.36,English,,0,0,0,,This course,the book and the course are one,they're very tied together
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.36,0:03:26.10,English,,0,0,0,,There'll be parts of the book that we don't go into all the details that are in the book sometimes
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.12,0:03:27.98,English,,0,0,0,,But we expect you to be able to figure it out
Dialogue: 0,0:03:28.80,0:03:33.90,English,,0,0,0,,And so really the course in the book are tied together
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.90,0:03:37.82,English,,0,0,0,,And they were very much the progress of the course the topics covered
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.24,0:03:44.22,English,,0,0,0,,How it's covered everything about it is consistent with the book
Dialogue: 0,0:03:45.24,0:03:49.32,English,,0,0,0,,We wrote the book because of the course think of them as course notes
Dialogue: 0,0:03:50.96,0:03:54.32,English,,0,0,0,,So and the reason why we are teaching this term by the way
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.32,0:03:59.30,English,,0,0,0,,We have't taught together in several years,but because this is the first roll out of this book
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.96,0:04:06.40,English,,0,0,0,,And not only is it being used here but it's actually used by about 250 schools around the world
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.94,0:04:16.76,English,,0,0,0,,And many of those people are also going through the same activities of teaching from this new edition for the first time
Dialogue: 0,0:04:17.18,0:04:21.90,English,,0,0,0,,And so we wanted to make sure all the material for the course was a sort of put in order and things
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.44,0:04:30.04,English,,0,0,0,,Because other universities and other colleges use this material...this supporting material we've developed
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.84,0:04:37.52,English,,0,0,0,,So that's the course and today is the first election we're sort of doing a tag team here
Dialogue: 0,0:04:37.52,0:04:41.94,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah I'll talk the high level what the course is about what the main themes are
Dialogue: 0,0:04:42.52,0:04:44.82,English,,0,0,0,,And Dave will talk more about the logistics
Dialogue: 0,0:04:48.40,0:04:52.18,English,,0,0,0,,So we refer the the thing we have that
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.14,0:05:01.84,English,,0,0,0,,When the very first time I typed the number of this course into a text editor
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.86,0:05:06.02,English,,0,0,0,,I realized I've typed those five digits many times in my career
Dialogue: 0,0:05:06.02,0:05:10.20,English,,0,0,0,,Because it's the zip code of CMU15-213
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.28,0:05:12.48,English,,0,0,0,,So that's where we come up with the same
Dialogue: 0,0:05:17.08,0:05:26.18,English,,0,0,0,,So there's a few things about this course for the most part you know in your normal undergraduate curriculum
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.32,0:05:31.74,English,,0,0,0,,When you've learned programming,you've been very much separated from the realities of the machine
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.78,0:05:38.88,English,,0,0,0,,You just think about code just you put some text into some little box
Dialogue: 0,0:05:39.10,0:05:46.62,English,,0,0,0,,Somehow, and outcomes of behavior that it hopefully is what you intended the program to do
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.06,0:05:54.04,English,,0,0,0,,The purpose of this course is to give you enough understanding of what that box is doing when it executes your code
Dialogue: 0,0:05:54.64,0:06:00.82,English,,0,0,0,,And through that to help you become better at what you're trying to do
Dialogue: 0,0:06:01.70,0:06:07.52,English,,0,0,0,,So some of the outcomes is there's really two types of outcomes from this course
Dialogue: 0,0:06:07.54,0:06:12.02,English,,0,0,0,,One is that if this is the only systems course you ever take in your whole life
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.36,0:06:17.94,English,,0,0,0,,You will get useful material from it,you will learn tools,tricks,methods
Dialogue: 0,0:06:18.38,0:06:32.20,English,,0,0,0,,That will help you if you ever are in involved in software development large-scale,software engineering projects,systems hardware design any aspect of computer technology
Dialogue: 0,0:06:32.20,0:06:35.14,English,,0,0,0,,This will help you be better at what you do
Dialogue: 0,0:06:35.58,0:06:41.08,English,,0,0,0,,You'll understand what programs do how they work,what the machines that support them do
Dialogue: 0,0:06:41.30,0:06:45.26,English,,0,0,0,,Why sometimes they work really well and why sometimes they don't work so well
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.94,0:06:54.14,English,,0,0,0,,It also is intended as it's sort of stepping stone into a whole number of other courses at CMU
Dialogue: 0,0:06:54.18,0:06:58.98,English,,0,0,0,, That will give you more in-depth understanding of computer technology
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.00,0:07:01.80,English,,0,0,0,, But our sort of specialized by topical area
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.34,0:07:07.60,English,,0,0,0,,Whether it's computer networking or operating systems or embedded systems
Dialogue: 0,0:07:08.50,0:07:16.90,English,,0,0,0,,Where you'll take the sort of ideas from this course and be able to then learn in a somewhat narrower but deeper sense what's really going on
Dialogue: 0,0:07:18.60,0:07:26.04,English,,0,0,0,,And so it really is trying to serve those two goals of making you more effective giving you useful ideas and tools right away
Dialogue: 0,0:07:26.32,0:07:28.60,English,,0,0,0,,But also preparing you for later courses
Dialogue: 0,0:07:29.82,0:07:36.56,English,,0,0,0,,So when we talked about this is sort of what's why what kind of stuff will you learn from this course
Dialogue: 0,0:07:37.10,0:07:44.74,English,,0,0,0,,It is to go through a series of what we call great realities places where sort of computers meet up
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.18,0:07:49.96,English,,0,0,0,,real-life computers get meet up against your expectations and maybe they're not quite the same
Dialogue: 0,0:07:50.46,0:07:57.44,English,,0,0,0,,so one of them is and the first part of the course is going to take a fairly detailed look how numbers are represented in computers
Dialogue: 0,0:07:57.92,0:08:04.96,English,,0,0,0,,And you'll learn some things that are on one hand surprising and another hand will start to make sense when you understand it better
Dialogue: 0,0:08:06.60,0:08:11.36,English,,0,0,0,,So a simple case is four numbers
Dialogue: 0,0:08:13.18,0:08:18.04,English,,0,0,0,,I don't know when it was but it was probably in about eighth grade algebra that I learned that
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.50,0:08:23.52,English,,0,0,0,,If you square a number it will be at least zero  if it's not an imaginary number
Dialogue: 0,0:08:23.74,0:08:33.22,English,,0,0,0,,So an integer or a real number you'd expect to square it and it to be a positive value or perhaps zero right?
Dialogue: 0,0:08:35.28,0:08:39.70,English,,0,0,0,,And that's actually generally true with floats a representation of floating-point number
Dialogue: 0,0:08:40.48,0:08:49.22,English,,0,0,0,,But with integers or int you know the computer representation of integers it's not so clear
Dialogue: 0,0:08:49.64,0:08:59.08,English,,0,0,0,, So for example if you square 40,000 on most computers then you'll get whatever that should be as you'd expect
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.96,0:09:02.00,English,,0,0,0,,But what if you square 50000?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.50,0:09:09.40,English,,0,0,0,,So you could do this in your head,but I actually built into this laptop computer
Dialogue: 0,0:09:09.52,0:09:12.66,English,,0,0,0,, So I'm going to go ahead and use it
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.98,0:09:16.78,English,,0,0,0,,amm...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:24.78,0:09:31.06,English,,0,0,0,,And use a tool which on UNIX systems is called...
Dialogue: 0,0:09:44.84,0:09:52.40,English,,0,0,0,,Linux systems is called GDB,but on Macintosh OS X it's called LLDB
Dialogue: 0,0:09:52.40,0:09:53.80,English,,0,0,0,,But they're pretty much the same program
Dialogue: 0,0:09:54.20,0:09:57.40,English,,0,0,0,,You will get to know this program really really well this term
Dialogue: 0,0:09:58.22,0:10:01.72,English,,0,0,0,,So like I said a few square 40,000
Dialogue: 0,0:10:03.16,0:10:04.28,English,,0,0,0,, you get...
Dialogue: 0,0:10:05.36,0:10:07.42,English,,0,0,0,,What you'd expect?
Dialogue: 0,0:10:09.38,0:10:12.04,English,,0,0,0,, But let's change this to 50,000
Dialogue: 0,0:10:17.50,0:10:23.60,English,,0,0,0,,And you get a very peculiar number that doesn't look anything like you'd expect 50,000 squared to be
Dialogue: 0,0:10:23.60,0:10:24.98,English,,0,0,0,,And in fact it's negative
Dialogue: 0,0:10:26.96,0:10:30.96,English,,0,0,0,,And so that might just seem like well there must be a mistake or something
Dialogue: 0,0:10:30.98,0:10:39.58,English,,0,0,0,,No that's just the way it is.Because this computer is expecting numbers to be represented as 32-bit values
Dialogue: 0,0:10:40.28,0:10:48.08,English,,0,0,0,,And the bit pattern that you get when you do this multiplication happens to be the representation of a negative number
Dialogue: 0,0:10:49.14,0:10:56.62,English,,0,0,0,, So that's a an example of where your normal expectations about integer arithmetic may or may not hold
Dialogue: 0,0:10:57.30,0:11:01.58,English,,0,0,0,,On the other hand...there are some places...
Dialogue: 0,0:11:08.08,0:11:15.02,English,,0,0,0,,If I try to do the same thing 300*400*500*600
Dialogue: 0,0:11:15.02,0:11:19.10,English,,0,0,0,,Then all of a sudden I also get a number that clearly is not what you'd expect
Dialogue: 0,0:11:19.10,0:11:20.82,English,,0,0,0,,Because the same thing has happened
Dialogue: 0,0:11:21.22,0:11:26.38,English,,0,0,0,,I've gotten an overflow it happens that it's overflowed to a value that's positive not negative
Dialogue: 0,0:11:26.40,0:11:30.96,English,,0,0,0,,But it still is obviously not the integer product of those four numbers
Dialogue: 0,0:11:31.94,0:11:42.80,English,,0,0,0,,On the other hand one thing you'll find is even though this arithmetic is not a normal sort of integer arithmetic
Dialogue: 0,0:11:43.90,0:11:47.56,English,,0,0,0,,It actually has some well-behaved properties
Dialogue: 0,0:11:48.00,0:11:50.30,English,,0,0,0,,So for example if you look at...
Dialogue: 0,0:11:53.96,0:11:59.72,English,,0,0,0,,What I've done is I just moved the 300 around from the beginning of the product to the end of the product
Dialogue: 0,0:12:00.46,0:12:04.30,English,,0,0,0,,So now if you think about how associativity and commutativity works
Dialogue: 0,0:12:04.90,0:12:07.92,English,,0,0,0,,I'm basically multiplying these four numbers in a different order
Dialogue: 0,0:12:08.64,0:12:14.44,English,,0,0,0,,But what you see is you get the same funny-looking result no matter how you do it
Dialogue: 0,0:12:14.48,0:12:18.72,English,,0,0,0,,So what you can say from this is integer arithmetic is commutative and associative so it obeys
Dialogue: 0,0:12:20.14,0:12:22.50,English,,0,0,0,,Some of the conventional mathematical properties
Dialogue: 0,0:12:22.86,0:12:25.78,English,,0,0,0,,It just isn't what you'd expect it to be
Dialogue: 0,0:12:25.78,0:12:35.02,English,,0,0,0,,It's not a normal sort of mathematical integer arithmetic
Dialogue: 0,0:12:36.56,0:12:50.00,English,,0,0,0,,So the cartoon here shows an example that's a similar possibility.We get to it
Dialogue: 0,0:12:58.50,0:13:00.42,English,,0,0,0,,Oh I guess it comes at the end
Dialogue: 0,0:13:01.26,0:13:08.88,English,,0,0,0,,So then the next question is is a addition associative right can you order the numbers
Dialogue: 0,0:13:09.20,0:13:15.52,English,,0,0,0,, And as you probably might have figured both in the integer arithmetic ,even though as this potential for overflow
Dialogue: 0,0:13:16.00,0:13:18.86,English,,0,0,0,,It is associative and it's commutative too
Dialogue: 0,0:13:19.82,0:13:22.44,English,,0,0,0,,But for floats it's not really quite the same
Dialogue: 0,0:13:23.48,0:13:30.92,English,,0,0,0,,Because the range of values you can get in floating pointers so extreme that some numbers kind of disappear on you
Dialogue: 0,0:13:30.94,0:13:35.34,English,,0,0,0,, So the example I'll show without having to use a computer to do it
Dialogue: 0,0:13:35.74,0:13:39.12,English,,0,0,0,,If you take a big number and subtract it from itself
Dialogue: 0,0:13:39.74,0:13:40.44,English,,0,0,0,,You'll get zero
Dialogue: 0,0:13:40.60,0:13:44.78,English,,0,0,0,,So if you add that to 3.14 you'll get 3.14
Dialogue: 0,0:13:45.72,0:13:52.82,English,,0,0,0,,But if you take those two numbers and you reorder the how you combine them
Dialogue: 0,0:13:53.04,0:13:59.18,English,,0,0,0,, So that 3.14 compared to -1e20 is so insignificant
Dialogue: 0,0:13:59.18,0:14:04.30,English,,0,0,0,,That that result gets turned into -1e20
Dialogue: 0,0:14:04.70,0:14:10.04,English,,0,0,0,,And you add that to 1e20 and you end up with zero.So it's not associative.
Dialogue: 0,0:14:10.56,0:14:18.62,English,,0,0,0,, And so what you see is the both these number systems have some peculiarities
Dialogue: 0,0:14:18.64,0:14:26.08,English,,0,0,0,,And it all comes down to the fact that they use finite representations of things that expanse
Dialogue: 0,0:14:26.68,0:14:30.10,English,,0,0,0,,So there's some compromises in how those work
Dialogue: 0,0:14:30.58,0:14:36.10,English,,0,0,0,,And what the compromise is you can overflow an integer and run out of room
Dialogue: 0,0:14:36.54,0:14:42.56,English,,0,0,0,,And in floating point numbers you have roundoff problems where you sort of drop the digits that are significant
Dialogue: 0,0:14:42.78,0:14:46.68,English,,0,0,0,,You can also overflow floating point but the more common problem is roundoff
Dialogue: 0,0:14:48.98,0:14:54.04,English,,0,0,0,,so this is shown in this cartoon this idea of overflow of somebody counting sheep
Dialogue: 0,0:14:54.72,0:14:59.02,English,,0,0,0,,Which in the u.s. is in English language at least a way to fall asleep
Dialogue: 0,0:14:59.68,0:15:05.02,English,,0,0,0,,And when he or she goes from 32,767
Dialogue: 0,0:15:05.48,0:15:10.52,English,,0,0,0,,And then increment set by one gets -32,768
Dialogue: 0,0:15:10.92,0:15:18.18,English,,0,0,0,,And we'll see exactly why that happens but basically the numbers are going  up to the larger value can represent
Dialogue: 0,0:15:18.18,0:15:20.50,English,,0,0,0,,And then when it goes one more it becomes a negative number
Dialogue: 0,0:15:24.98,0:15:28.36,English,,0,0,0,, So these are really important under things to understand
Dialogue: 0,0:15:28.36,0:15:34.54,English,,0,0,0,,I mean 90% of the time maybe you can just get by writing programs and not worrying about
Dialogue: 0,0:15:34.54,0:15:37.98,English,,0,0,0,,Whether your numbers are going to exceed their possible range
Dialogue: 0,0:15:38.50,0:15:45.40,English,,0,0,0,,But they sometimes when this could be really important if you're like you know controlling a rocket
Dialogue: 0,0:15:45.90,0:15:52.84,English,,0,0,0,,You really don't want the positive thrust to become negative or something like that
Dialogue: 0,0:15:53.00,0:15:57.24,English,,0,0,0,,So you can see you there this could be an important consideration
Dialogue: 0,0:15:57.76,0:16:02.32,English,,0,0,0,, Similarly there's well-known instances of security vulnerabilities
Dialogue: 0,0:16:02.34,0:16:08.58,English,,0,0,0,,Where somebody wrote code that sort of expected a positive number in some place.
Dialogue: 0,0:16:08.88,0:16:14.36,English,,0,0,0,,A clever person figured out if I supply a negative number I can fool the system and give it to do bad things
Dialogue: 0,0:16:14.92,0:16:19.22,English,,0,0,0,,So these are the kind of corner cases that you need to understand better
Dialogue: 0,0:16:19.22,0:16:23.88,English,,0,0,0,,If you're either working in programs where it's really really important that it worked correctly
Dialogue: 0,0:16:24.38,0:16:27.55,English,,0,0,0,, Or you're really worried about security vulnerabilities
Dialogue: 0,0:16:27.88,0:16:32.64,English,,0,0,0,,Anytime you have possible four corner cases you have to understand these nuances better
Dialogue: 0,0:16:33.76,0:16:39.32,English,,0,0,0,,Similarly for floating-point if you're going to use floating-point for serious computation
Dialogue: 0,0:16:39.60,0:16:46.18,English,,0,0,0,, Whether it's scientific research or for designing bridges or nuclear power plants or something
Dialogue: 0,0:16:46.64,0:16:48.54,English,,0,0,0,,You better understand what the characteristics are
Dialogue: 0,0:16:50.84,0:16:57.70,English,,0,0,0,, So that's our first one and we'll spend a couple weeks talking about numbers number of representations and their properties here
Dialogue: 0,0:16:59.26,0:17:05.48,English,,0,0,0,,The second is we're going to spend a lot of time in this course learning about machine level programming meaning
Dialogue: 0,0:17:05.90,0:17:10.20,English,,0,0,0,,What the instructions are that actually get executed by the computer
Dialogue: 0,0:17:10.52,0:17:15.34,English,,0,0,0,, And that can be described in assembly language which is a text version of it
Dialogue: 0,0:17:15.78,0:17:21.30,English,,0,0,0,,Or an object code which is the actual bit level binary encoding of instructions
Dialogue: 0,0:17:21.30,0:17:26.46,English,,0,0,0,, and we'll learn a fair bit about that and spend a fair amount of time seeing.
Dialogue: 0,0:17:26.48,0:17:34.06,English,,0,0,0,,How code that you write in C gets turned into machine code and how that gets executed on the machine
Dialogue: 0,0:17:34.80,0:17:41.38,English,,0,0,0,,One thing I'll say is it historically courses like this would teach assembly code by having you write
Dialogue: 0,0:17:41.86,0:17:47.69,English,,0,0,0,,programs in assembly that do various things not usually very interesting
Dialogue: 0,0:17:47.69,0:17:50.40,English,,0,0,0,,Because it's a lot of work to write assembly program
Dialogue: 0,0:17:50.80,0:17:55.18,English,,0,0,0,,This course is much more about taking the assembly code that's been generated by a compiler
Dialogue: 0,0:17:55.88,0:18:02.68,English,,0,0,0,, A C compiler and looking at it and understanding it that's a different set of skills than you need to write it on your own
Dialogue: 0,0:18:05.88,0:18:11.10,English,,0,0,0,,In particular we're going to look at the language of of Intel processors
Dialogue: 0,0:18:11.14,0:18:18.94,English,,0,0,0,,The most recent versions of them are called x86-64 the 64-bit version of their instruction set
Dialogue: 0,0:18:19.36,0:18:23.21,English,,0,0,0,,And one thing that's new in this course compared to previous one
Dialogue: 0,0:18:23.72,0:18:25.72,English,,0,0,0,,We used to teach 32-bit stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:18:26.64,0:18:29.38,English,,0,0,0,,This course is 64 bits all the time
Dialogue: 0,0:18:32.76,0:18:39.76,English,,0,0,0,,Another one that we'll talk about a fair amount that is really fairly visible to programmers surprisingly visible is
Dialogue: 0,0:18:40.10,0:18:45.28,English,,0,0,0,,It's aspects of the memory system so modern computers have a very complex
Dialogue: 0,0:18:45.58,0:18:52.80,English,,0,0,0,, layered memory system to try give you to hight performance in high capacity at the same time
Dialogue: 0,0:18:53.22,0:18:58.12,English,,0,0,0,,And there's some results of that system that can mean that.
Dialogue: 0,0:18:58.18,0:19:01.42,English,,0,0,0,,If you program write a program well it might work really well
Dialogue: 0,0:19:01.74,0:19:07.04,English,,0,0,0,,If you don't it could run very poorly because it's not making use of this hierarchical memory system
Dialogue: 0,0:19:07.74,0:19:12.96,English,,0,0,0,,So and also there's a lot of bugs that show up especially in C programs
Dialogue: 0,0:19:13.50,0:19:16.30,English,,0,0,0,,That have to do with memory referencing errors
Dialogue: 0,0:19:16.54,0:19:23.34,English,,0,0,0,,So understanding what those errors are what their manifestation is how to prevent them as a big part of the course
Dialogue: 0,0:19:24.44,0:19:32.86,English,,0,0,0,,So for example if I define a struct that contains a two integer values A in an array
Dialogue: 0,0:19:32.90,0:19:35.94,English,,0,0,0,,And a double precision floating point number d
Dialogue: 0,0:19:36.30,0:19:43.94,English,,0,0,0,,And if I this function fun you'll see what it does is it's given an argument i
Dialogue: 0,0:19:44.26,0:19:49.10,English,,0,0,0,,And it sets the element of a to some strange-looking value
Dialogue: 0,0:19:50.00,0:19:58.56,English,,0,0,0,,so as you know I should really only be either 0 or 1 with this code
Dialogue: 0,0:19:58.58,0:20:03.44,English,,0,0,0,, Because that's the range of possible values of this array a
Dialogue: 0,0:20:04.58,0:20:08.32,English,,0,0,0,,But we can try other things too so...
Dialogue: 0,0:20:09.38,0:20:15.78,English,,0,0,0,, In particular if you run it on either one or two you'll get what you'd expect
Dialogue: 0,0:20:16.18,0:20:21.38,English,,0,0,0,,That you assigned a 3.14 to element d of this structure
Dialogue: 0,0:20:22.10,0:20:24.90,English,,0,0,0,, And when you read it back you get the same thing
Dialogue: 0,0:20:26.30,0:20:33.43,English,,0,0,0,,And in fact but now if I set a of two to this number
Dialogue: 0,0:20:33.43,0:20:36.48,English,,0,0,0,,All of a sudden you'll see that my floating number which
Dialogue: 0,0:20:37.34,0:20:40.32,English,,0,0,0,,seems to have nothing to do with a has changed
Dialogue: 0,0:20:40.48,0:20:43.86,English,,0,0,0,,And if I do that same thing with...
Dialogue: 0,0:20:44.40,0:20:49.32,English,,0,0,0,,I equal to three you'll see I get a number that's closer to two then to 3.14
Dialogue: 0,0:20:51.10,0:20:52.34,English,,0,0,0,, And if I keep going
Dialogue: 0,0:20:53.88,0:21:04.82,English,,0,0,0,,Well nothing much happens util I hit (fun)(6) and then the program crashes
Dialogue: 0,0:21:05.42,0:21:10.66,English,,0,0,0,,So something interesting is going on here at least something quirky is going on
Dialogue: 0,0:21:11.42,0:21:17.62,English,,0,0,0,,And the reason is again it has to do with how data is laid out in memory and
Dialogue: 0,0:21:17.86,0:21:21.88,English,,0,0,0,,How its accessed and one of the features of C and C++
Dialogue: 0,0:21:22.30,0:21:27.12,English,,0,0,0,,It doesn't do any bounds checking on a race it will happily let you reference
Dialogue: 0,0:21:27.58,0:21:33.14,English,,0,0,0,,element number five million of a two element array and not complain
Dialogue: 0,0:21:33.24,0:21:36.36,English,,0,0,0,,But the operating system might complain as it did here
Dialogue: 0,0:21:37.08,0:21:44.76,English,,0,0,0,,And it in this particular structure and we'll see more about how structures are implemented and weighed out
Dialogue: 0,0:21:45.20,0:21:51.70,English,,0,0,0,,But basically the two if each of these uh walks in this vertical chain represents four bytes
Dialogue: 0,0:21:52.38,0:21:55.56,English,,0,0,0,,So the two elements of a each are four bytes
Dialogue: 0,0:21:56.04,0:22:03.55,English,,0,0,0,,'d' is eight bytes and then there's some other stuff in the other beyond them
Dialogue: 0,0:22:04.22,0:22:06.78,English,,0,0,0,,That's not actually in the structured zone
Dialogue: 0,0:22:07.56,0:22:12.28,English,,0,0,0,,So you'll see that if I reference either a[0] or a[1]
Dialogue: 0,0:22:13.14,0:22:17.08,English,,0,0,0,,Then I will just modify that array as designed
Dialogue: 0,0:22:17.48,0:22:20.24,English,,0,0,0,,But when I'm calling fun(2) or fun(3)
Dialogue: 0,0:22:20.24,0:22:26.28,English,,0,0,0,,What I'm actually doing is altering the bytes that encode this number 'd'
Dialogue: 0,0:22:26.54,0:22:29.60,English,,0,0,0,, and that's why you saw the sort of funny numbers come out it.
Dialogue: 0,0:22:29.90,0:22:32.72,English,,0,0,0,, I go up at some point when I hit 6
Dialogue: 0,0:22:32.74,0:22:36.04,English,,0,0,0,,I'm modifying some state of the program that
Dialogue: 0,0:22:36.04,0:22:43.60,English,,0,0,0,,It's using to kind of keep things organized most likely how it keeps track of allocated memory
Dialogue: 0,0:22:44.18,0:22:46.72,English,,0,0,0,,And that's causing the program to crash
Dialogue: 0,0:22:47.76,0:22:53.72,English,,0,0,0,,So this is a pretty good demonstration of a why C programming can drive you crazy
Dialogue: 0,0:22:54.52,0:23:02.04,English,,0,0,0,,Because as you saw it doesn't do bounds checking so it's easy to write code that does invalid stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:23:04.18,0:23:12.00,English,,0,0,0,,It's also often the case that you'll cause some problem and it has a sort of action a distance feature that
Dialogue: 0,0:23:12.00,0:23:16.50,English,,0,0,0,,You can modify some think you're modifying some data structure
Dialogue: 0,0:23:16.92,0:23:20.24,English,,0,0,0,,And what you're doing because of the way things are organized in memory
Dialogue: 0,0:23:20.58,0:23:23.70,English,,0,0,0,,You're changing something totally unrelated somewhere else in the program
Dialogue: 0,0:23:24.72,0:23:26.96,English,,0,0,0,,You'd imagine they're not just one apart but they're 10,000 apart
Dialogue: 0,0:23:28.42,0:23:33.04,English,,0,0,0,,And things might just run fine for hours days or weeks
Dialogue: 0,0:23:33.68,0:23:37.78,English,,0,0,0,,And then always say at some point that data that got corrupted
Dialogue: 0,0:23:38.14,0:23:42.34,English,,0,0,0,,A long time ago gets accessed and something goes wrong
Dialogue: 0,0:23:42.64,0:23:47.17,English,,0,0,0,,So this can be some of the worst nightmare debugging nightmares
Dialogue: 0,0:23:47.17,0:23:50.92,English,,0,0,0,,that exists on earth is to try and figure out memory referencing errors
Dialogue: 0,0:23:54.90,0:23:59.66,English,,0,0,0,,so this is actually one argument not to program in C or C++
Dialogue: 0,0:24:00.42,0:24:02.48,English,,0,0,0,,And it's a valid argument all
Dialogue: 0,0:24:02.84,0:24:07.02,English,,0,0,0,,But also as a person who's right in a lot of C programming
Dialogue: 0,0:24:07.06,0:24:13.62,English,,0,0,0,,You just get more experienced and you know at times that you should actually put bounds checking in your own code
Dialogue: 0,0:24:13.80,0:24:21.34,English,,0,0,0,, And there's also tools available that will help you sort of bullet proof your code
Dialogue: 0,0:24:21.34,0:24:23.34,English,,0,0,0,,So that it will detect these kind of problems
Dialogue: 0,0:24:24.12,0:24:28.33,English,,0,0,0,,So it's not like you have to change languages but it is a particular feature of these languages
Dialogue: 0,0:24:30.72,0:24:38.20,English,,0,0,0,,And so understanding sort of the Machine level representation of data structures and how they work is very really makes a huge difference
Dialogue: 0,0:24:38.22,0:24:41.82,English,,0,0,0,, in your ability to deal with these kind of vulnerabilities
Dialogue: 0,0:24:43.18,0:24:45.74,English,,0,0,0,,and things of ulnar abilities by the way also from a security perspective
Dialogue: 0,0:24:50.38,0:24:55.64,English,,0,0,0,,The fourth sort of theme we'll cover in the courses  getting performance out of programs
Dialogue: 0,0:24:56.18,0:24:58.70,English,,0,0,0,,Other parts of the curriculum in CS
Dialogue: 0,0:24:59.10,0:25:02.84,English,,0,0,0,,do much more emphasis on getting the right algorithm at the right data structure
Dialogue: 0,0:25:03.40,0:25:06.78,English,,0,0,0,,And that's really well and good it's important stuff I don't deny it
Dialogue: 0,0:25:07.16,0:25:13.58,English,,0,0,0,, But they some amount of the sort of low-level optimization that you need to do
Dialogue: 0,0:25:14.02,0:25:17.42,English,,0,0,0,,That you need to understand what the system does
Dialogue: 0,0:25:17.68,0:25:20.14,English,,0,0,0,,What makes it run well what makes it run poorly
Dialogue: 0,0:25:20.50,0:25:22.68,English,,0,0,0,,In order to be able to do that kind of optimization
Dialogue: 0,0:25:23.72,0:25:25.98,English,,0,0,0,, So the example we like to use is
Dialogue: 0,0:25:27.24,0:25:33.90,English,,0,0,0,,These two functions do exactly the same thing in terms of their...their behavior
Dialogue: 0,0:25:34.28,0:25:45.32,English,,0,0,0,,What they do is copy a matrix or array from called source 'src' to a destination 'dst'
Dialogue: 0,0:25:45.68,0:25:53.34,English,,0,0,0,,They're both size to be 2048 rows 2048 columns two-dimensional arrays
Dialogue: 0,0:25:54.10,0:26:00.76,English,,0,0,0,,And you'll see that the program's do the obvious thing you have a nested pair of loops to do the row and column indices
Dialogue: 0,0:26:01.12,0:26:05.72,English,,0,0,0,,And you just copy from one source element to a destination element
Dialogue: 0,0:26:06.26,0:26:11.74,English,,0,0,0,, The only thing that's different you'll see is that the two loops
Dialogue: 0,0:26:11.74,0:26:15.45,English,,0,0,0,,Their nesting is different the nesting order is different
Dialogue: 0,0:26:15.45,0:26:19.10,English,,0,0,0,,One case I'm going kind of row first
Dialogue: 0,0:26:21.30,0:26:25.86,English,,0,0,0,,going through all the rows and then the columns and the other is for any given row
Dialogue: 0,0:26:26.12,0:26:29.90,English,,0,0,0,,I'm copying all the columns that's really the only difference between these two programs
Dialogue: 0,0:26:31.18,0:26:34.06,English,,0,0,0,,But what you'll find if you run it on a typical system
Dialogue: 0,0:26:34.68,0:26:37.10,English,,0,0,0,,It's that one is much faster than the other
Dialogue: 0,0:26:37.10,0:26:43.48,English,,0,0,0,,In this particular machine we ran it on it was about close to 20 times difference in performance
Dialogue: 0,0:26:43.48,0:26:52.32,English,,0,0,0,,So something fishy is going on if the same program that differs only in this seemingly insignificant way
Dialogue: 0,0:26:52.34,0:26:57.88,English,,0,0,0,,A way that has no effect whatsoever on its functionality can have this much performance difference
Dialogue: 0,0:26:58.62,0:27:03.14,English,,0,0,0,,And so to understand this you need to stare at the cover of the book
Dialogue: 0,0:27:07.74,0:27:16.00,English,,0,0,0,,Because basically you're two different points of this strange-looking picture that's on your book
Dialogue: 0,0:27:16.04,0:27:20.12,English,,0,0,0,,And since there's no axis or labels on it it makes no sense whatsoever
Dialogue: 0,0:27:20.76,0:27:21.74,English,,0,0,0,,But it's there
Dialogue: 0,0:27:23.06,0:27:28.60,English,,0,0,0,,so what you see is this picture shows for different memory access patterns I won't go into the details
Dialogue: 0,0:27:29.42,0:27:37.86,English,,0,0,0,,What the throughput measured in megabytes per second on basically a copying program was
Dialogue: 0,0:27:38.70,0:27:41.46,English,,0,0,0,,And without going into the details what you'll see is
Dialogue: 0,0:27:41.86,0:27:46.42,English,,0,0,0,,These two functions sort of sit at different points in this memory access pattern
Dialogue: 0,0:27:46.84,0:27:52.04,English,,0,0,0,, The one that goes through a row by row is much better than the one that goes through column by column
Dialogue: 0,0:27:53.94,0:28:00.62,English,,0,0,0,,And as a result you're getting a lot better performance and it has to do with this memory hierarchy and what they call the cache memories
Dialogue: 0,0:28:01.22,0:28:06.40,English,,0,0,0,,That you're getting way better performance out of it in one case than the other
Dialogue: 0,0:28:06.72,0:28:11.56,English,,0,0,0,,So that's explains what the cover of the book is about
Dialogue: 0,0:28:11.82,0:28:13.88,English,,0,0,0,,We'll talk about it more later in the course
Dialogue: 0,0:28:15.40,0:28:21.76,English,,0,0,0,,And then a final part of the course talks more about not just getting computers to run little programs in isolation
Dialogue: 0,0:28:21.76,0:28:28.76,English,,0,0,0,,But getting computers that talk to each other over networks implement services like web servers
Dialogue: 0,0:28:28.92,0:28:34.96,English,,0,0,0,,And other functions like that which of course is where most of the world of computing sits today
Dialogue: 0,0:28:34.96,0:28:41.26,English,,0,0,0,,It's not just isolated machines but computers they internet with each other over the networks
Dialogue: 0,0:28:41.26,0:28:45.92,English,,0,0,0,,They're embedded controllers that are interacting with the physical world
Dialogue: 0,0:28:45.92,0:28:50.16,English,,0,0,0,,So really the the world of computers is a much richer environment
Dialogue: 0,0:28:50.42,0:28:54.26,English,,0,0,0,,And we'll cover at least some aspects of that in the final part of this course
Dialogue: 0,0:28:58.22,0:29:02.22,English,,0,0,0,,So as I mentioned the other feature of this course
Dialogue: 0,0:29:02.24,0:29:06.16,English,,0,0,0,,It will get you ready for other systems courses you might take  at CMU
Dialogue: 0,0:29:06.44,0:29:14.08,English,,0,0,0,,And here we've listed actually a subset of the courses at the university that require this course is a prerequisite
Dialogue: 0,0:29:14.48,0:29:18.82,English,,0,0,0,,And they're mostly in computer science and ECE
Dialogue: 0,0:29:19.08,0:29:23.18,English,,0,0,0,,But you'll see it's quite a range of different courses
Dialogue: 0,0:29:23.72,0:29:31.22,English,,0,0,0,,And each of them builds on to one or multiple aspects of the material you learn in the course
Dialogue: 0,0:29:31.88,0:29:37.70,English,,0,0,0,,So the reason why we make everyone take this course including incoming master's students
Dialogue: 0,0:29:38.28,0:29:44.70,English,,0,0,0,, It's that all these other courses at the university have come to rely on students being familiar
Dialogue: 0,0:29:45.10,0:29:51.42,English,,0,0,0,, and having done the work of to 13 or 513 as a prerequisite
Dialogue: 0,0:29:51.42,0:29:57.84,English,,0,0,0,,And they can build on that material and sort of cover more ground as a result rather than having to do
Dialogue: 0,0:29:58.04,0:30:01.20,English,,0,0,0,,What would otherwise be somewhat remedial work on it
Dialogue: 0,0:30:01.22,0:30:08.94,English,,0,0,0,,And in fact one of the part of the genesis of this course was the people who taught the operating system course a 410
Dialogue: 0,0:30:10.04,0:30:15.84,English,,0,0,0,,Sort of complained that they were spending too much time at the beginning of the course talking about some very basics of machine programming
Dialogue: 0,0:30:16.44,0:30:20.16,English,,0,0,0,,And Dave and I said oh well we can cover that
Dialogue: 0,0:30:20.26,0:30:22.82,English,,0,0,0,,So that was part of what got this course started
Dialogue: 0,0:30:25.16,0:30:31.78,English,,0,0,0,,I mentioned that the course has a sort of perspective that's very different from traditional systems course
Dialogue: 0,0:30:31.98,0:30:35.90,English,,0,0,0,,Most systems courses including that whole array you saw there
Dialogue: 0,0:30:35.96,0:30:41.82,English,,0,0,0,,we're about how do I build some particular feature,how do I implement an operating system
Dialogue: 0,0:30:42.02,0:30:44.60,English,,0,0,0,,How do I design a pipeline microprocessor?
Dialogue: 0,0:30:46.06,0:30:48.92,English,,0,0,0,, And those it's all important stuff to know
Dialogue: 0,0:30:49.06,0:30:56.00,English,,0,0,0,,We really want the people who are out there building operating systems and designing microprocessors to learn how to do it
Dialogue: 0,0:30:57.50,0:31:02.30,English,,0,0,0,,On the other hand is a way to sort of get new into this and get the introduction and get the experience
Dialogue: 0,0:31:02.84,0:31:06.44,English,,0,0,0,,We find it more useful to take what we call a programmers perspective
Dialogue: 0,0:31:07.14,0:31:17.36,English,,0,0,0,,meaning understanding what you as a person who sits in front of a computer screen types code
Dialogue: 0,0:31:17.56,0:31:22.56,English,,0,0,0,,I need to know about that machine you're typing code for in order to be effective at doing it
Dialogue: 0,0:31:23.12,0:31:28.46,English,,0,0,0,,As opposed to somebody who some day going to be designing the the actual machine itself
Dialogue: 0,0:31:28.96,0:31:34.64,English,,0,0,0,,So that by taking that perspective it gives you sort of an understanding
Dialogue: 0,0:31:34.68,0:31:38.52,English,,0,0,0,,So now when you go off to implement it you'll actually know what these features are
Dialogue: 0,0:31:38.52,0:31:41.44,English,,0,0,0,,Why it's important to implement them well
Dialogue: 0,0:31:41.74,0:31:45.44,English,,0,0,0,,But also that's by doing this programmers perspective it
Dialogue: 0,0:31:45.46,0:31:49.90,English,,0,0,0,,Lets you right away get tools that you can use in other places
Dialogue: 0,0:31:49.90,0:31:55.24,English,,0,0,0,,Where you're writing programs are doing anything related to it and be more effective at that
Dialogue: 0,0:31:55.44,0:32:01.84,English,,0,0,0,,So this programmers perspective really gives this this dual benefit to it
Dialogue: 0,0:32:02.72,0:32:08.32,English,,0,0,0,,We feel is very useful and students who've taken the course in the past have expressed that as well
Dialogue: 0,0:32:09.52,0:32:14.30,English,,0,0,0,,So as I mentioned we have two instructors for the course
Dialogue: 0,0:32:15.32,0:32:17.48,English,,0,0,0,,And they also happen to be authors
Dialogue: 0,0:32:17.72,0:32:23.66,English,,0,0,0,,The longest,we've probably taught this course more than anyone else
Dialogue: 0,0:32:23.66,0:32:26.66,English,,0,0,0,, But it's also taught by other people on campus as well
Dialogue: 0,0:32:27.70,0:32:32.98,English,,0,0,0,,So what I'm going to do now is hand my pair of microphones over two days
Dialogue: 0,0:32:34.55,0:32:38.02,English,,0,0,0,, All right welcome good afternoon it's great to see you
Dialogue: 0,0:32:38.02,0:32:40.02,English,,0,0,0,,My name is Dave O'Halloran
Dialogue: 0,0:32:40.56,0:32:48.12,English,,0,0,0,,And I'm just delighted to have the opportunity to be one of your instructors this term
Dialogue: 0,0:32:49.98,0:32:56.24,English,,0,0,0,,This course is one of the reason I'm so excited to be teaching
Dialogue: 0,0:32:56.24,0:32:58.16,English,,0,0,0,,I just love this course
Dialogue: 0,0:32:58.72,0:33:04.74,English,,0,0,0,,The real the reason is the the opportunity of represents to have an impact on people's lives
Dialogue: 0,0:33:05.12,0:33:07.68,English,,0,0,0,,We really believe that the material you learned this semester
Dialogue: 0,0:33:08.28,0:33:13.38,English,,0,0,0,,can have a really positive and long-lasting impact on on your careers
Dialogue: 0,0:33:14.12,0:33:19.88,English,,0,0,0,,And it'll help you not only with your future classes but also future positions you have
Dialogue: 0,0:33:20.64,0:33:27.16,English,,0,0,0,,And I hear this from people all all the time from CMU students
Dialogue: 0,0:33:27.50,0:33:32.64,English,,0,0,0,,Students around the world who have taken the equivalent of 213 it at their schools
Dialogue: 0,0:33:33.48,0:33:40.18,English,,0,0,0,,I even though a couple years ago we were interviewing a faculty member tenure tenure-track faculty member
Dialogue: 0,0:33:40.60,0:33:43.62,English,,0,0,0,, Who went to did his undergrad at CMU
Dialogue: 0,0:33:43.94,0:33:51.32,English,,0,0,0,,And then went off to Stanford got his PhD at Stanford and was coming back to you know join the faculty
Dialogue: 0,0:33:52.08,0:33:56.54,English,,0,0,0,,And he told me that 213 changed his life in our interview
Dialogue: 0,0:33:56.54,0:33:59.10,English,,0,0,0,,Now I don't know if he was trying to butter me up
Dialogue: 0,0:33:59.10,0:34:00.88,English,,0,0,0,,But I think I believe him
Dialogue: 0,0:34:00.88,0:34:05.78,English,,0,0,0,,He said it changed his whole life in the sense that it gave him a research direction
Dialogue: 0,0:34:05.78,0:34:12.98,English,,0,0,0,,You know he didn't really know what he knew it kind of like computer science but it didn't really know what direction to go
Dialogue: 0,0:34:13.56,0:34:19.88,English,,0,0,0,,After he took 213 he knew they wanted to to do his word was life's work in systems
Dialogue: 0,0:34:20.56,0:34:25.66,English,,0,0,0,,Now it was just remarkable right to come down and tap we ended up actually hiring him
Dialogue: 0,0:34:26.32,0:34:31.10,English,,0,0,0,,He told me that everybody in his lab at Stanford all of the grad students had a copy of the book on their desk
Dialogue: 0,0:34:31.90,0:34:35.20,English,,0,0,0,,from and they were from all over you know all different schools
Dialogue: 0,0:34:36.58,0:34:44.32,English,,0,0,0,,And so I mean I even I was in a bookstore in Beijing a couple years ago right outside the PKU campus
Dialogue: 0,0:34:45.14,0:34:49.22,English,,0,0,0,,I was up on the fifth floor trying to see if I could find a copy of the textbook
Dialogue: 0,0:34:49.64,0:34:53.54,English,,0,0,0,,And I found the English version in one aisle
Dialogue: 0,0:34:54.84,0:34:57.70,English,,0,0,0,,And then a couple miles over I found the Chinese version
Dialogue: 0,0:34:57.72,0:35:03.40,English,,0,0,0,,I was going through the Chinese version and this guy taps me on my shoulder
Dialogue: 0,0:35:04.04,0:35:10.56,English,,0,0,0,,And I turned around,he says oh man that that book is really good you should the English version is two aisles over
Dialogue: 0,0:35:13.88,0:35:19.66,English,,0,0,0,,And I mean it just blew me away to be to be in the head of someone like
Dialogue: 0,0:35:20.14,0:35:23.96,English,,0,0,0,,halfway around the world it was just that it was just one of those moments
Dialogue: 0,0:35:24.22,0:35:30.28,English,,0,0,0,,So I'm not trying to boast, I'm just trying what I want I want to give you the sense of.
Dialogue: 0,0:35:30.28,0:35:35.84,English,,0,0,0,,what it what an opportunity this course represents for Miranda and I to to have
Dialogue: 0,0:35:35.84,0:35:42.06,English,,0,0,0,,what we hope will be a really positive impact on on your lives
Dialogue: 0,0:35:43.84,0:35:50.06,English,,0,0,0,, So let me we have kind of a kind of a funny organization for the course
Dialogue: 0,0:35:51.34,0:35:56.04,English,,0,0,0,,in response to that just the the tremendous demand we have we found that we have for it
Dialogue: 0,0:35:57.00,0:36:01.34,English,,0,0,0,,So there's there's actually three course numbers but it's all the same course
Dialogue: 0,0:36:02.36,0:36:07.28,English,,0,0,0,,It's the identical course 513, 15-513 is for our master students.
Dialogue: 0,0:36:07.92,0:36:14.38,English,,0,0,0,,and the 15-513 doesn't have a formal lecture so there's no seats assigned to it
Dialogue: 0,0:36:14.96,0:36:17.50,English,,0,0,0,,It instead we'll videotape the lectures
Dialogue: 0,0:36:18.42,0:36:23.30,English,,0,0,0,,And e'll make those available on the course web web page for our graduate students
Dialogue: 0,0:36:24.16,0:36:31.66,English,,0,0,0,,The reason we do this is just because in the past well we didn't have enough seats for everyone
Dialogue: 0,0:36:31.92,0:36:37.90,English,,0,0,0,,And there would be cases where there might be a hundred 150 master students on the waitlist
Dialogue: 0,0:36:38.46,0:36:39.88,English,,0,0,0,, They wouldn't be able to get into the course
Dialogue: 0,0:36:40.78,0:36:44.38,English,,0,0,0,,We didn't really want that because they need this course for to take other courses
Dialogue: 0,0:36:45.94,0:36:53.02,English,,0,0,0,,So that's the reason why we have this this sort of does not meet version of 213,513
Dialogue: 0,0:36:53.02,0:36:57.72,English,,0,0,0,,Because we can admit as many all the master's students that that need to take the course
Dialogue: 0,0:36:58.42,0:37:07.84,English,,0,0,0,,Now 15-213 and 18-213 or are for undergraduates in computer science and ECE respectively
Dialogue: 0,0:37:12.36,0:37:19.18,English,,0,0,0,,The undergraduates will go to lectures and recitations okay in person graduate students will watch videotapes of those
Dialogue: 0,0:37:19.78,0:37:20.62,English,,0,0,0,,But otherwise,yes
Dialogue: 0,0:37:21.20,0:37:24.64,English,,0,0,0,,[students question]
Dialogue: 0,0:37:26.34,0:37:28.74,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah we're making them available to everyone actually
Dialogue: 0,0:37:30.76,0:37:31.30,English,,0,0,0,, sorry
Dialogue: 0,0:37:33.10,0:37:35.96,English,,0,0,0,,And lecture slides as well everything's available on the course web page
Dialogue: 0,0:37:40.68,0:37:41.88,English,,0,0,0,,So you'll be doing
Dialogue: 0,0:37:45.72,0:37:56.60,English,,0,0,0,,The all of students will have equal access to office hours,the staff mailing list and everybody does the same labs and the same exams
Dialogue: 0,0:37:57.02,0:38:01.86,English,,0,0,0,, Okay so it's just a question it's just a matter of whether you're good a lecture in person or if you watch it on video
Dialogue: 0,0:38:02.22,0:38:06.84,English,,0,0,0,,In fact if you know since it's available to everybody if you miss lecture it'll be there
Dialogue: 0,0:38:07.18,0:38:10.06,English,,0,0,0,,on the webpage  you can catch up which I know you'll probably do
Dialogue: 0,0:38:10.64,0:38:12.86,English,,0,0,0,,Actually I know most of you will never miss class
Dialogue: 0,0:38:13.40,0:38:16.26,English,,0,0,0,,Right,but the few of you who do now you'll be able to watch the video
Dialogue: 0,0:38:19.68,0:38:25.04,English,,0,0,0,,Okay.All right this is the one part,this part I hate
Dialogue: 0,0:38:26.40,0:38:29.66,English,,0,0,0,, I love teaching that this is the one part teaching that
Dialogue: 0,0:38:30.20,0:38:34.46,English,,0,0,0,,None of us really like.But we have to talk about it and that's academic integrity
Dialogue: 0,0:38:36.48,0:38:43.42,English,,0,0,0,,If you're new on campus coming from a international school
Dialogue: 0,0:38:43.64,0:38:47.02,English,,0,0,0,,If you're an international student new on campus
Dialogue: 0,0:38:48.20,0:38:52.84,English,,0,0,0,, There might be different notions of academic integrity
Dialogue: 0,0:38:53.58,0:38:59.52,English,,0,0,0,,And different notions of cheating at your undergraduate school your old school
Dialogue: 0,0:39:00.32,0:39:03.44,English,,0,0,0,,So if you're new on campus pay very close attention to this
Dialogue: 0,0:39:03.66,0:39:09.44,English,,0,0,0,,Because at Carnegie Mellon we take academic integrity very seriously
Dialogue: 0,0:39:10.90,0:39:15.94,English,,0,0,0,,Okay it's not a wink wink nod nod,we're very serious about it
Dialogue: 0,0:39:18.18,0:39:23.44,English,,0,0,0,,We want everybody doing their own work to preserve the integrity of the courses
Dialogue: 0,0:39:25.98,0:39:27.96,English,,0,0,0,,So what exactly is cheating?
Dialogue: 0,0:39:29.76,0:39:31.64,English,,0,0,0,, So if you share code with anybody
Dialogue: 0,0:39:31.80,0:39:39.48,English,,0,0,0,,either copying,retyping,if looking at somebody's code like,if you look at somebody's code on the screen
Dialogue: 0,0:39:41.46,0:39:42.90,English,,0,0,0,,Or if you give somebody a file
Dialogue: 0,0:39:43.88,0:39:50.16,English,,0,0,0,,All of those,all of those examples of sharing are cheating
Dialogue: 0,0:39:52.32,0:39:56.92,English,,0,0,0,,If you describe your code like line by line to somebody that's cheating
Dialogue: 0,0:40:00.08,0:40:04.38,English,,0,0,0,,If you coach somebody line by line that's cheating
Dialogue: 0,0:40:07.48,0:40:11.54,English,,0,0,0,,Searching the web for solutions just the act of searching is cheating
Dialogue: 0,0:40:12.44,0:40:16.20,English,,0,0,0,,This is a real problem for us in particular
Dialogue: 0,0:40:16.20,0:40:20.96,English,,0,0,0,,Because the course is I offered all around the world and
Dialogue: 0,0:40:22.40,0:40:26.22,English,,0,0,0,,People either maliciously or or sometimes just they're proud of their work
Dialogue: 0,0:40:26.22,0:40:29.38,English,,0,0,0,,And they post it you know for employers on like public github sites
Dialogue: 0,0:40:31.18,0:40:35.80,English,,0,0,0,,So it might be tempting to to search for these solutions
Dialogue: 0,0:40:37.22,0:40:39.14,English,,0,0,0,,But even the act of searching is cheating
Dialogue: 0,0:40:40.12,0:40:44.88,English,,0,0,0,,And definitely if you find some a solution in and use it.That's cheating
Dialogue: 0,0:40:45.48,0:40:47.10,English,,0,0,0,,Even if you modify it afterwards
Dialogue: 0,0:40:48.94,0:40:53.78,English,,0,0,0,,And I just want you to remember I know how to use Google just as well as anybody else right
Dialogue: 0,0:40:53.78,0:40:56.60,English,,0,0,0,,So I can search for solutions too
Dialogue: 0,0:41:02.02,0:41:12.00,English,,0,0,0,,So copying code you know you might be tempted to copy code from someone who took the class you know in a previous semester
Dialogue: 0,0:41:12.46,0:41:14.98,English,,0,0,0,,Don't do it,that's that's cheating too
Dialogue: 0,0:41:15.80,0:41:16.62,English,,0,0,0,,Now what's not cheating?
Dialogue: 0,0:41:16.64,0:41:19.52,English,,0,0,0,,So you can help each other use tools
Dialogue: 0,0:41:20.64,0:41:22.84,English,,0,0,0,,You know somebody's having trouble using gdb
Dialogue: 0,0:41:22.84,0:41:28.12,English,,0,0,0,,You know they have questions about how to run use a text editor
Dialogue: 0,0:41:28.38,0:41:32.68,English,,0,0,0,,That stuff's all great you help each other out using the tools
Dialogue: 0,0:41:32.68,0:41:35.26,English,,0,0,0,,How to login the shark machines all of that kind of stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:41:37.78,0:41:41.98,English,,0,0,0,,You can help you can discuss sort of high-level design issues and that's probably a good idea
Dialogue: 0,0:41:41.98,0:41:42.26,English,,0,0,0,,Yes
Dialogue: 0,0:41:42.26,0:41:46.82,English,,0,0,0,,[student speaking]
Dialogue: 0,0:41:46.90,0:41:49.70,English,,0,0,0,,Yeah yeah did you take it a previous semester
Dialogue: 0,0:41:49.70,0:41:55.30,English,,0,0,0,,[student speaking]
Dialogue: 0,0:41:55.30,0:42:00.14,English,,0,0,0,,Okay yeah the question was if you took it in a previous semester can you use your work and the answer is yes
Dialogue: 0,0:42:04.38,0:42:08.32,English,,0,0,0,,So you can also talk to each other about high level you know design issues
Dialogue: 0,0:42:08.86,0:42:16.02,English,,0,0,0,,You know how are you using an explicit list or using a segregated list for your Malik lab
Dialogue: 0,0:42:16.52,0:42:23.56,English,,0,0,0,,That kind of stuff is okay, high level okay low level not okay
Dialogue: 0,0:42:24.18,0:42:27.02,English,,0,0,0,,Basically what we want you to write your own code
Dialogue: 0,0:42:28.86,0:42:32.28,English,,0,0,0,,This is not,you know it's kind of a cut and paste world these days
Dialogue: 0,0:42:32.28,0:42:37.96,English,,0,0,0,,Right you look stuff up on Google, StackOverflow you cut and paste it
Dialogue: 0,0:42:39.38,0:42:41.40,English,,0,0,0,,But that's not that's not the way we do it
Dialogue: 0,0:42:42.44,0:42:45.36,English,,0,0,0,,Here we want you to do the work yourself
Dialogue: 0,0:42:45.36,0:42:51.72,English,,0,0,0,,We want you to enjoy the experience of figuring things out  and learning how to solve problems
Dialogue: 0,0:42:55.20,0:42:58.96,English,,0,0,0,,Now the consequences for cheating there's a single sanction
Dialogue: 0,0:43:00.84,0:43:05.32,English,,0,0,0,,If you're caught cheating you'll be expelled from the course with an R
Dialogue: 0,0:43:05.64,0:43:12.10,English,,0,0,0,,There's no exceptions alright if you drop the course we'll just reinstate you and then flunk you
Dialogue: 0,0:43:12.76,0:43:15.04,English,,0,0,0,,[students laugh]

Dialogue: 0,0:45:59.20,0:46:00.82,English,,0,0,0,,So what I would encourage all of you to do
Dialogue: 0,0:46:00.82,0:46:04.00,English,,0,0,0,,I'm not sure if anybody has ever taken this advice but I say it every year
Dialogue: 0,0:46:04.00,0:46:05.94,English,,0,0,0,,anyway because I believe it
Dialogue: 0,0:46:06.74,0:46:14.14,English,,0,0,0,,But I think a really good strategy for studying and preparing for this course would be to read each chapter three times
Dialogue: 0,0:46:16.96,0:46:20.48,English,,0,0,0,,Read three times work the practice problems
Dialogue: 0,0:46:20.48,0:46:26.36,English,,0,0,0,,So we have littered throughout the book or practice problems with solutions at  the end of the chapter
Dialogue: 0,0:46:26.58,0:46:30.12,English,,0,0,0,,And these practice problems are like little sort of bite-size morsels just kind of
Dialogue: 0,0:46:30.52,0:46:35.74,English,,0,0,0,,just to kind of check your kind of a sanity check of your understanding of the material
Dialogue: 0,0:46:36.88,0:46:41.78,English,,0,0,0,,I think if you read this if you read the book each chapter three times and work the practice problems

Dialogue: 0,0:47:01.24,0:47:04.06,English,,0,0,0,,It's still the best book around I think for C
Dialogue: 0,0:47:04.58,0:47:08.02,English,,0,0,0,,It's a beautiful example of technical writing
Dialogue: 0,0:47:08.02,0:47:16.78,English,,0,0,0,, It was one of the inspirations I used when I was writing the book，you know I tried to find that same clarity and precision

Dialogue: 0,0:47:24.50,0:47:26.28,English,,0,0,0,, So this is a this is a really good book

Dialogue: 0,0:47:28.38,0:47:30.66,English,,0,0,0,,But it's a kind of book you can just read from beginning to end

Dialogue: 0,0:47:38.34,0:47:41.54,English,,0,0,0,,There's four main components to the course
Dialogue: 0,0:47:41.54,0:47:46.46,English,,0,0,0,,There's lectures where we go over the high level concepts recitations where
Dialogue: 0,0:47:46.82,0:47:52.48,English,,0,0,0,,Which meet once a week for an hour led by a TA
Dialogue: 0,0:47:52.48,0:47:56.36,English,,0,0,0,,The purpose of the recitations is really to help you with the labs
Dialogue: 0,0:47:56.82,0:47:58.70,English,,0,0,0,,So it's very practical and hands-on
Dialogue: 0,0:47:59.64,0:48:05.82,English,,0,0,0,,There's seven of those labs and these are really the heart and soul of the course
Dialogue: 0,0:48:05.82,0:48:09.26,English,,0,0,0,,This is where all the real learning comes in I think
Dialogue: 0,0:48:09.26,0:48:11.87,English,,0,0,0,,When you actually have to do this stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:48:12.46,0:48:14.80,English,,0,0,0,,And that's why we take the cheating parts so seriously
Dialogue: 0,0:48:14.82,0:48:20.89,English,,0,0,0,,Because if you do these labs you're going to learn an incredible amount of really cool stuff
Dialogue: 0,0:48:21.74,0:48:23.42,English,,0,0,0,,If you don't do them you won't learn anything
Dialogue: 0,0:48:26.44,0:48:30.42,English,,0,0,0,,So each one of these labs is 1-2 weeks each
Dialogue: 0,0:48:32.18,0:48:36.22,English,,0,0,0,,And involves typically some kind of programming or measurement
Dialogue: 0,0:48:36.86,0:48:39.68,English,,0,0,0,,There's also two exams a midterm and a final
Dialogue: 0,0:48:40.00,0:48:50.98,English,,0,0,0,,The exams are proctored they're online proctored in Wien and and gates
Dialogue: 0,0:48:51.40,0:48:55.10,English,,0,0,0,,What we do for the exams is we have like we take like four days

Dialogue: 0,0:48:58.08,0:49:01.02,English,,0,0,0,,And then we have like multiple clusters that are Network isolated

Dialogue: 0,0:49:05.34,0:49:09.18,English,,0,0,0,,And the midterm is like nominally like an hour eighty minute
Dialogue: 0,0:49:09.42,0:49:14.80,English,,0,0,0,, exam it's the same exam we use we gave when we used to have people sitting in person
Dialogue: 0,0:49:15.48,0:49:20.52,English,,0,0,0,,So it's nominally like 80 minutes but we give you like a five or six hour window to do it
Dialogue: 0,0:49:21.24,0:49:26.87,English,,0,0,0,,Okay so there's so you can sign up any time any day that there's a slot
Dialogue: 0,0:49:27.28,0:49:30.94,English,,0,0,0,,Okay so there's flexibility so you can kind of tailor it to your schedule
Dialogue: 0,0:49:31.38,0:49:34.96,English,,0,0,0,,And we I think we've also removed all the time pressure  right so which is

Dialogue: 0,0:49:40.80,0:49:45.40,English,,0,0,0,,And not be worried about how quickly you do it
Dialogue: 0,0:49:51.34,0:49:53.84,English,,0,0,0,,now there's many different ways to get help
Dialogue: 0,0:49:53.84,0:49:56.54,English,,0,0,0,,The main source of information is the course web page
Dialogue: 0,0:49:57.34,0:50:03.36,English,,0,0,0,,That's http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213
Dialogue: 0,0:50:04.14,0:50:08.62,English,,0,0,0,,All the information is there.We've got a complete schedule of lectures and assignments

Dialogue: 0,0:50:17.68,0:50:25.70,English,,0,0,0,,We've actually even got all of the lectures posted ahead of time for for the other instructors around the world who are using the book
Dialogue: 0,0:50:25.70,0:50:28.00,English,,0,0,0,,So we needed to get them all already
Dialogue: 0,0:50:29.70,0:50:33.78,English,,0,0,0,,There's also news at the at the very beginning there's sort of news
Dialogue: 0,0:50:33.78,0:50:37.20,English,,0,0,0,,If we need to make announcements we'll post it there
Dialogue: 0,0:50:38.02,0:50:41.40,English,,0,0,0,,We don't use either blackboard or Piazza in the course
Dialogue: 0,0:50:43.44,0:50:47.77,English,,0,0,0,,Instead we have a staff mailing list
Dialogue: 0,0:50:48.42,0:50:52.32,English,,0,0,0,,That you can send mail to if you have questions
Dialogue: 0,0:50:52.92,0:50:58.42,English,,0,0,0,,And all of the TAS and all of the faculty are subscribed to that staff mailing list
Dialogue: 0,0:50:58.42,0:51:00.10,English,,0,0,0,,And so we'll all see it
Dialogue: 0,0:51:01.28,0:51:05.12,English,,0,0,0,,And we usually we try to have you know really fast feedback right
Dialogue: 0,0:51:05.54,0:51:11.26,English,,0,0,0,,So there's so many people looking at at your emails
Dialogue: 0,0:51:11.26,0:51:14.62,English,,0,0,0,,That chance is very high you'll get on and answer back quickly
Dialogue: 0,0:51:14.88,0:51:20.50,English,,0,0,0,,The the disadvantage of having this advantage of this mailing list is that it allows us to control the message
Dialogue: 0,0:51:22.78,0:51:26.36,English,,0,0,0,,And control what we're it's what feedback we' re giving back to you
Dialogue: 0,0:51:26.72,0:51:31.30,English,,0,0,0,,The disadvantage is that we often get the same question over and over again
Dialogue: 0,0:51:31.80,0:51:37.14,English,,0,0,0,,So for that we've established a FAQ if we find we're getting same questions over and over
Dialogue: 0,0:51:37.30,0:51:40.80,English,,0,0,0,,We've established a FAQ on the course web page
Dialogue: 0,0:51:41.26,0:51:49.20,English,,0,0,0,, For it sort of organized by labs,so you can see the answers to frequently asked questions
Dialogue: 0,0:51:52.54,0:52:00.00,English,,0,0,0,,We have office hours they were still trying to we were still trying to meet with the staff and

Dialogue: 0,0:52:01.60,0:52:08.18,English,,0,0,0,,But what we're thinking now is that we'll have office hours six days a week every day but Saturday
Dialogue: 0,0:52:10.30,0:52:23.68,English,,0,0,0,,They will be at the same time and same place every day so from 5:45 to 8:30 in WeH in a queen 5207 cluster

Dialogue: 0,0:52:52.82,0:52:54.22,English,,0,0,0,,So we don't have any group projects
Dialogue: 0,0:52:55.58,0:52:57.50,English,,0,0,0,,We want you to do the work yourself
Dialogue: 0,0:52:57.50,0:53:04.46,English,,0,0,0,, Now you know it's important to work in groups and you will learn how to work in groups Other classes CS classes
Dialogue: 0,0:53:04.46,0:53:09.14,English,,0,0,0,,But not in 213 we want this is a kind of a core course we want you to figure stuff out yourself

Dialogue: 0,0:53:20.78,0:53:24.06,English,,0,0,0,, And all of our hand-ins are using autolab
Dialogue: 0,0:53:25.58,0:53:29.78,English,,0,0,0,,Where you know you've probably used it for some of your other classes
Dialogue: 0,0:53:29.78,0:53:36.62,English,,0,0,0,,But it's a Auto grading service that allows you to get instant feedback on your handin
Dialogue: 0,0:53:36.64,0:53:39.56,English,,0,0,0,,So when you hand it in you get feedback right away
Dialogue: 0,0:53:40.46,0:53:45.86,English,,0,0,0,,The exams like I mentioned are going to be a network isolated clusters held over multiple days
Dialogue: 0,0:53:46.80,0:53:50.54,English,,0,0,0,,You can just sign up for a slot that's available now
Dialogue: 0,0:53:51.26,0:53:56.46,English,,0,0,0,,What usually happens if we offer like the exam Tuesday Wednesday and Thursday
Dialogue: 0,0:53:56.46,0:53:58.90,English,,0,0,0,,The Thursday slots fill up immediately
Dialogue: 0,0:54:03.48,0:54:07.40,English,,0,0,0,,I guess I should try to sign up soon if you want
Dialogue: 0,0:54:07.40,0:54:11.18,English,,0,0,0,, But people always seem to want to defer to the end rather than
Dialogue: 0,0:54:11.52,0:54:13.48,English,,0,0,0,,And if it's me I'd want to get it over with
Dialogue: 0,0:54:16.06,0:54:19.12,English,,0,0,0,,So I just that that is sort of a constraint right that
Dialogue: 0,0:54:20.00,0:54:24.44,English,,0,0,0,,You can only sign up for slots that that available
Dialogue: 0,0:54:26.04,0:54:31.48,English,,0,0,0,,Okay now you know we make mistakes there's we always make mistakes especially with so many students
Dialogue: 0,0:54:32.50,0:54:38.38,English,,0,0,0,, So we there's a specific process for appealing grades
Dialogue: 0,0:54:38.38,0:54:43.50,English,,0,0,0,, If you think that there was a pitcher the work wasn't graded properly
Dialogue: 0,0:54:44.20,0:54:49.70,English,,0,0,0,, So what you do after after either an exam or after your labs are graded
Dialogue: 0,0:54:50.52,0:54:53.02,English,,0,0,0,, You have seven days to file an appeal
Dialogue: 0,0:54:53.54,0:54:57.12,English,,0,0,0,,And appeals have to be in writing and hardcopy
Dialogue: 0,0:54:57.88,0:55:03.12,English,,0,0,0,, Okay so there's no we won't consider any email any appeals via email
Dialogue: 0,0:55:03.50,0:55:07.88,English,,0,0,0,,It has to be in writing and hardcopy  and you give those to me
Dialogue: 0,0:55:08.42,0:55:10.36,English,,0,0,0,,If I'm not there you can just slide it under the desk
Dialogue: 0,0:55:12.54,0:55:18.98,English,,0,0,0,, And what the reason we do it that way is it allows us to treat everybody fairly
Dialogue: 0,0:55:18.98,0:55:21.80,English,,0,0,0,,We get all the appeals together at once
Dialogue: 0,0:55:22.44,0:55:28.72,English,,0,0,0,,And then we can treat everybody the same way rather than just sort of doing them one at a time like that
Dialogue: 0,0:55:34.06,0:55:41.42,English,,0,0,0,,Now for our labs we have ten machines that were donated by Intel called the shark machines
Dialogue: 0,0:55:42.28,0:55:44.84,English,,0,0,0,,So initially our first version of 213
Dialogue: 0,0:55:47.40,0:55:54.02,English,,0,0,0,,I guess we started using Intel machines in 1999,we used to alpha processors for the first year
Dialogue: 0,0:55:54.76,0:55:56.24,English,,0,0,0,,I like to fish
Dialogue: 0,0:55:56.60,0:55:59.36,English,,0,0,0,,So all of our machines work they were called the fish machines right
Dialogue: 0,0:55:59.38,0:56:00.58,English,,0,0,0,, they were freshwater fish
Dialogue: 0,0:56:01.82,0:56:06.70,English,,0,0,0,,And then we upgraded a few years after that and those were the saltwater fish machines
Dialogue: 0,0:56:07.68,0:56:12.70,English,,0,0,0,,And then we upgraded like in 2011 to these Nehalem class servers
Dialogue: 0,0:56:13.16,0:56:16.40,English,,0,0,0,,And run out of fresh water fish and saltwater fish
Dialogue: 0,0:56:16.40,0:56:19.52,English,,0,0,0,, So the next grade up was sharks right
Dialogue: 0,0:56:20.00,0:56:22.98,English,,0,0,0,, So every fish is it's named after some kind of shark
Dialogue: 0,0:56:23.64,0:56:29.42,English,,0,0,0,,But these are the same machines that that you know that auto lab uses grading right
Dialogue: 0,0:56:29.42,0:56:35.82,English,,0,0,0,,So there's some consistency for performance oriented labs like milk lab
Dialogue: 0,0:56:36.08,0:56:42.04,English,,0,0,0,,And you can access them that they're you the names are listed on the course webpage
Dialogue: 0,0:56:42.04,0:56:45.12,English,,0,0,0,,And so you can SSH to a specific machine
Dialogue: 0,0:56:45.38,0:56:46.34,English,,0,0,0,,They're all identical
Dialogue: 0,0:56:46.70,0:56:50.68,English,,0,0,0,,If you have an Andrew account you've already got accounts on the machines right so there's nothing special to do
Dialogue: 0,0:56:51.10,0:56:57.62,English,,0,0,0,, Or you can just SSH to sharp that ICS and you'll just randomly put you on on one of the shark machines
Dialogue: 0,0:56:59.86,0:57:05.74,English,,0,0,0,,Okay if you have any trouble logging in just send send mail to the staff mailing list
Dialogue: 0,0:57:09.38,0:57:17.60,English,,0,0,0,, Okay we know that during the semester things come up grandparents died especially near the near the final
Dialogue: 0,0:57:22.80,0:57:24.00,English,,0,0,0,,That's harsh
Dialogue: 0,0:57:25.16,0:57:27.71,English,,0,0,0,,But that things come up right and you've got your very busy
Dialogue: 0,0:57:27.71,0:57:29.29,English,,0,0,0,,You're taking a lot of courses
Dialogue: 0,0:57:29.84,0:57:33.08,English,,0,0,0,,So instead of sort of dealing with requests for extensions
Dialogue: 0,0:57:33.96,0:57:36.48,English,,0,0,0,, And you know all these special cases what we do
Dialogue: 0,0:57:37.04,0:57:43.14,English,,0,0,0,,It's we give you five grace days that you can then spend as you wish
Dialogue: 0,0:57:44.42,0:57:50.47,English,,0,0,0,, So if you hand your work in late one day late you'll automatically consume a grace day
Dialogue: 0,0:57:51.36,0:57:54.52,English,,0,0,0,,Okay we don't allow you to sort of allocate the grace days
Dialogue: 0,0:57:54.52,0:57:57.36,English,,0,0,0,,You spend one of your grace days by handing in late
Dialogue: 0,0:57:58.38,0:58:00.78,English,,0,0,0,,so if you have a great day left then you hand in late
Dialogue: 0,0:58:01.56,0:58:04.88,English,,0,0,0,,You'll spend that grace day but you won't be penalized for the late hand in
Dialogue: 0,0:58:05.76,0:58:09.68,English,,0,0,0,,So we have five grace days over the entire semester
Dialogue: 0,0:58:10.16,0:58:16.96,English,,0,0,0,,And a maximum of two grace days for the assignments
Dialogue: 0,0:58:16.96,0:58:23.02,English,,0,0,0,,Now we're going to set up since the first three assignments are kind of not as programming intensive
Dialogue: 0,0:58:23.92,0:58:25.70,English,,0,0,0,, And don't take as much time
Dialogue: 0,0:58:26.48,0:58:28.78,English,,0,0,0,,We're not going to allow any grace days for those
Dialogue: 0,0:58:28.78,0:58:33.04,English,,0,0,0,,Because...a one grace day one sorry one grace day
Dialogue: 0,0:58:33.50,0:58:39.90,English,,0,0,0,,And then for the the latter for labs which are much more intense we're going to allow you to a max of two grades days
Dialogue: 0,0:58:40.46,0:58:46.06,English,,0,0,0,,And the reason we're doing this is because we don't want you to burn your grade these grace days are valuable
Dialogue: 0,0:58:46.84,0:58:51.94,English,,0,0,0,,They're critical especially later in the semester when it have you really dizzy
Dialogue: 0,0:58:53.80,0:58:57.54,English,,0,0,0,,So we don't want you to burn up your grace days early in the semester
Dialogue: 0,0:58:57.54,0:58:59.26,English,,0,0,0,,And this happens every semester
Dialogue: 0,0:58:59.60,0:59:03.38,English,,0,0,0,,And it and then when Malik lab comes up there's no grace days left
Dialogue: 0,0:59:03.84,0:59:06.16,English,,0,0,0,,It's really sad to see that
Dialogue: 0,0:59:07.62,0:59:10.14,English,,0,0,0,,So we're going to limit you to one for those first three
Dialogue: 0,0:59:11.30,0:59:13.32,English,,0,0,0,,Just to help you save you from yourself
Dialogue: 0,0:59:15.90,0:59:19.36,English,,0,0,0,,Now...
Dialogue: 0,0:59:20.58,0:59:26.28,English,,0,0,0,,The nominal late penalty if you don't have a grace days 15% per day
Dialogue: 0,0:59:27.32,0:59:32.12,English,,0,0,0,,And we don't allow any handin its three days after the due at all
Dialogue: 0,0:59:32.12,0:59:34.76,English,,0,0,0,,So that our lab shuts off
Dialogue: 0,0:59:37.14,0:59:40.08,English,,0,0,0,,Now if there is some kind of catastrophic about
Dialogue: 0,0:59:40.70,0:59:45.94,English,,0,0,0,,Then you know please contact us  for an extension right so why not
Dialogue: 0,0:59:46.50,0:59:47.78,English,,0,0,0,,You know we try to be reasonable
Dialogue: 0,0:59:47.78,0:59:54.08,English,,0,0,0,, But most of the reasons that for requesting extensions
Dialogue: 0,0:59:54.08,0:59:57.42,English,,0,0,0,,You can handle yourself about using your grades days
Dialogue: 0,1:00:00.56,1:00:04.84,English,,0,0,0,, And just I mean this is this is advice I give every semester too
Dialogue: 0,1:00:08.02,1:00:11.57,English,,0,0,0,,But it's people often don't don't pay attention but or
Dialogue: 0,1:00:12.00,1:00:18.58,English,,0,0,0,,just they're unable to but but really you for every one of these assignments you want to start early
Dialogue: 0,1:00:20.16,1:00:24.66,English,,0,0,0,,And the reason is you need to give yourself time to to go seek help if you get stuck
Dialogue: 0,1:00:25.70,1:00:31.24,English,,0,0,0,, Because the nature of these very programming intensive assignments like we have in 213 is that you're going to get stuck
Dialogue: 0,1:00:32.04,1:00:37.30,English,,0,0,0,,And often it's very hard to to bound the time you spend on on some of these assignments
Dialogue: 0,1:00:38.48,1:00:41.60,English,,0,0,0,,You know it's not like problem sets where you can kind of predict you know this will take
Dialogue: 0,1:00:42.16,1:00:44.74,English,,0,0,0,,Others will take me like three hours to do do these problem sets for
Dialogue: 0,1:00:45.68,1:00:51.38,English,,0,0,0,, A lot of the 213 assignments it's very difficult to to sort of manage your time and bound your time
Dialogue: 0,1:00:51.60,1:00:57.10,English,,0,0,0,,So for that reason you really want to start early to give yourself a chance to get help when you get stuck
Dialogue: 0,1:00:58.28,1:01:03.54,English,,0,0,0,,Now in the lecture hall you're permitted to have your laptops
Dialogue: 0,1:01:06.70,1:01:13.68,English,,0,0,0,, But we ask you not to send email or instant messaging or cell phone texting or anything like that
Dialogue: 0,1:01:13.68,1:01:17.24,English,,0,0,0,,If you hear we want you to to be attentive and engaged
Dialogue: 0,1:01:20.94,1:01:25.94,English,,0,0,0,,Your presence in lectures and recitations is voluntary so we don't take
Dialogue: 0,1:01:26.54,1:01:28.34,English,,0,0,0,,We don't take role at either of those
Dialogue: 0,1:01:29.18,1:01:36.06,English,,0,0,0,,We encourage you to come but it's not required and no recordings of any kind except this one
Dialogue: 0,1:01:39.66,1:01:45.46,English,,0,0,0,,Okay the exams and labs are weighted equally 50% midterms 20 finals 30
Dialogue: 0,1:01:45.98,1:01:50.68,English,,0,0,0,,final grades are based on a straight 90,80,70 scale
Dialogue: 0,1:01:52.94,1:01:55.28,English,,0,0,0,,Now rough outline of the semester
Dialogue: 0,1:01:57.34,1:02:03.92,English,,0,0,0,,The first three labs cover programs representations of programs and data
Dialogue: 0,1:02:04.36,1:02:08.66,English,,0,0,0,,Data lab is how we teach you about bit level representations of data
Dialogue: 0,1:02:09.28,1:02:16.44,English,,0,0,0,,So you'll sell collection of puzzles and see like a puzzle might be is a little function
Dialogue: 0,1:02:16.86,1:02:19.56,English,,0,0,0,,that you have to implement like absolute value
Dialogue: 0,1:02:19.56,1:02:23.58,English,,0,0,0,,So a function that returns the absolute value of its input argument
Dialogue: 0,1:02:24.32,1:02:28.24,English,,0,0,0,,The kicker is that we restrict the set of operators that you can use
Dialogue: 0,1:02:28.24,1:02:30.84,English,,0,0,0,,And it has to be straight line code no conditionals or loops
Dialogue: 0,1:02:32.28,1:02:33.90,English,,0,0,0,,So to solve these puzzles
Dialogue: 0,1:02:34.18,1:02:37.94,English,,0,0,0,,So imagine how you might try to solve absolute value without using an if statement
Dialogue: 0,1:02:38.24,1:02:44.68,English,,0,0,0,,The normal way to do it would be if X less than 0 return X or negative X
Dialogue: 0,1:02:47.58,1:02:50.12,English,,0,0,0,,see I told you we make mistakes
Dialogue: 0,1:02:50.60,1:02:56.16,English,,0,0,0,,But imagine how you might do that without using conditionals and only using bit levels C operations
Dialogue: 0,1:02:57.02,1:03:05.86,English,,0,0,0,,Right so this is how this is our way of teaching you how data is really represented in the machine
Dialogue: 0,1:03:06.64,1:03:09.36,English,,0,0,0,,Now the bomblab which you've probably heard at this is
Dialogue: 0,1:03:10.18,1:03:15.92,English,,0,0,0,,This is a kind of famous all over the world now and at CMU
Dialogue: 0,1:03:16.36,1:03:21.32,English,,0,0,0,,The bomb lab is the way we teach you how to read and understand assembly language
Dialogue: 0,1:03:22.60,1:03:31.40,English,,0,0,0,,And a bomb just briefly a bomb is it is a C program that consists of a collection of six phases
Dialogue: 0,1:03:32.68,1:03:35.86,English,,0,0,0,,And each phase wants you to type something in at the keyboard
Dialogue: 0,1:03:36.82,1:03:41.66,English,,0,0,0,,If you type in the what it wants you to type what it expects you type
Dialogue: 0,1:03:43.02,1:03:46.66,English,,0,0,0,,Then you've diffused that phase and it goes to the next phase
Dialogue: 0,1:03:46.98,1:03:48.46,English,,0,0,0,,Then you have to type what that phase
Dialogue: 0,1:03:49.84,1:03:52.76,English,,0,0,0,,And if you defuse all the phases then you've diffused the bomb
Dialogue: 0,1:03:54.10,1:03:59.10,English,,0,0,0,,However if you type in the wrong thing then the bomb explodes by printing boom
Dialogue: 0,1:04:00.08,1:04:01.78,English,,0,0,0,,And you have to try it again
Dialogue: 0,1:04:02.70,1:04:05.92,English,,0,0,0,,And the kicker is in either case when if you explode the bomb
Dialogue: 0,1:04:06.56,1:04:12.12,English,,0,0,0,,Or defuse a phase that information gets sent to auto lab
Dialogue: 0,1:04:12.56,1:04:17.44,English,,0,0,0,,If you expand we use the defusing string that that your bomb sends us
Dialogue: 0,1:04:17.98,1:04:22.48,English,,0,0,0,,And we check it out on a copy of your bomb that we keep on the server
Dialogue: 0,1:04:22.94,1:04:27.74,English,,0,0,0,,That's another thing every everybody gets a different bomb slightly different bomb
Dialogue: 0,1:04:29.80,1:04:36.08,English,,0,0,0,,So we check so when you defuse when you defuse a phase the auto lab takes the string that
Dialogue: 0,1:04:36.68,1:04:40.38,English,,0,0,0,,that your bomb sends us and then compares against the local copy of your bomb
Dialogue: 0,1:04:41.42,1:04:44.42,English,,0,0,0,,If you explode phase you lose half a point
Dialogue: 0,1:04:46.10,1:04:49.36,English,,0,0,0,,So there's a real consequence to exploding your bomb it's very very tense right
Dialogue: 0,1:04:53.10,1:04:56.50,English,,0,0,0,,Until you learn how to use GDB to set a breakpoint
Dialogue: 0,1:04:57.44,1:05:01.06,English,,0,0,0,,Before the function that sends the information to the server
Dialogue: 0,1:05:02.30,1:05:04.00,English,,0,0,0,,And we want you to do that right
Dialogue: 0,1:05:04.40,1:05:09.60,English,,0,0,0,,So a bombs are really the bombs really beautiful it's kind of fun it's kind of like a video game
Dialogue: 0,1:05:11.56,1:05:16.20,English,,0,0,0,,It teaches you how to read compiler generated code
Dialogue: 0,1:05:16.60,1:05:20.42,English,,0,0,0,,Because the only oh the kicker is sorry that
Dialogue: 0,1:05:20.42,1:05:25.98,English,,0,0,0,,The kicker is we don't give you the source code all we give you is the binary the binary bomb
Dialogue: 0,1:05:26.42,1:05:29.98,English,,0,0,0,,So in order to defuse a bomb you've got to fire up gdb
Dialogue: 0,1:05:30.66,1:05:35.40,English,,0,0,0,,Single trace through the find where the code is for each phase single trace through that code
Dialogue: 0,1:05:36.18,1:05:39.40,English,,0,0,0,,And sort of reverse engineer and figure out what it wants you to type in
Dialogue: 0,1:05:41.18,1:05:46.80,English,,0,0,0,,And then you'll quickly find out where that function that explodes the bomb is  and you'll put a breakpoint there
Dialogue: 0,1:05:48.18,1:05:50.80,English,,0,0,0,, And so we want you to do that because
Dialogue: 0,1:05:51.34,1:05:57.88,English,,0,0,0,,The bomb besides teaching you how to program assembly language  it also teaches you sort of organically how to use gdb
Dialogue: 0,1:05:57.90,1:06:01.06,English,,0,0,0,,Because you really can't do it if you don't use if you don't run gdb
Dialogue: 0,1:06:04.34,1:06:07.42,English,,0,0,0,,And then the the third lab is this is a new lab
Dialogue: 0,1:06:07.66,1:06:11.42,English,,0,0,0,,This semester the randy's develops called the attack lab
Dialogue: 0,1:06:12.04,1:06:17.38,English,,0,0,0,,And we developed this lab specifically for 64-bit architecture
Dialogue: 0,1:06:17.38,1:06:20.90,English,,0,0,0,,So this is a reflection of the change from 32 bits to 64 bits
Dialogue: 0,1:06:22.58,1:06:26.40,English,,0,0,0,,And this is so we're really excited about this one you'll learn how to
Dialogue: 0,1:06:27.58,1:06:36.96,English,,0,0,0,, you'll learn how to write exploits using return to a sort of a modern technique called return to return oriented programming
Dialogue: 0,1:06:37.56,1:06:46.54,English,,0,0,0,,Which is kind of the modern modern way that hackers deal with the fact that stacks in newer machines move around
Dialogue: 0,1:06:46.78,1:06:54.22,English,,0,0,0,,And prohibitive and make it impossible to execute code on the on the stack
Dialogue: 0,1:06:54.90,1:06:59.28,English,,0,0,0,,So this is a brand new labs really I think it's really going to be really going to be neat
Dialogue: 0,1:07:01.80,1:07:05.48,English,,0,0,0,,In the memory hierarchy when we study the memory hierarchy
Dialogue: 0,1:07:05.66,1:07:08.24,English,,0,0,0,, We have a cache lab called the cache lab
Dialogue: 0,1:07:08.56,1:07:10.68,English,,0,0,0,,Where you'll build your own cache simulator
Dialogue: 0,1:07:10.68,1:07:18.12,English,,0,0,0,,so this is how sort of learn how this hardware that Randy was mentioning called cache memory works
Dialogue: 0,1:07:18.86,1:07:20.84,English,,0,0,0,,You'll build a simulator and see for that
Dialogue: 0,1:07:21.62,1:07:24.46,English,,0,0,0,,And then you'll take a small transpose function
Dialogue: 0,1:07:25.12,1:07:31.09,English,,0,0,0,,And you'll try to make that that code run with as few misses as possible on your simulator
Dialogue: 0,1:07:31.50,1:07:37.14,English,,0,0,0,,And this will involve sort of understanding of how the memory hierarchy works and how to exploit it
Dialogue: 0,1:07:41.56,1:07:45.78,English,,0,0,0,,The part of the course where you we sort of transition from hardware
Dialogue: 0,1:07:45.78,1:07:51.10,English,,0,0,0,,to interacting with the system software  that the operating system
Dialogue: 0,1:07:52.62,1:08:01.04,English,,0,0,0,,There's sort of a concept that we call exceptional control flow that exists in all parts of the system
Dialogue: 0,1:08:01.36,1:08:06.42,English,,0,0,0,,And it sort of represents that intellectual transition from hardware to software
Dialogue: 0,1:08:06.66,1:08:13.26,English,,0,0,0,,So this is how this was sort of a key idea that allowed us to kind of smoothly
Dialogue: 0,1:08:13.80,1:08:18.84,English,,0,0,0,,move from from hardware to software in some intellectually consistent way
Dialogue: 0,1:08:19.32,1:08:26.10,English,,0,0,0,,And so the idea is that you cover an exceptional control flow like low hard, low-level hardware interrupts and exceptions
Dialogue: 0,1:08:26.58,1:08:32.00,English,,0,0,0,,And then at the higher level sort of involving hardware and operating system software
Dialogue: 0,1:08:32.16,1:08:34.74,English,,0,0,0,,is the idea of an operate of a process context switch
Dialogue: 0,1:08:36.10,1:08:40.06,English,,0,0,0,,So this is this is where you start to learn what processes are
Dialogue: 0,1:08:40.38,1:08:46.10,English,,0,0,0,, and how to ask the kernel to create in() for you
Dialogue: 0,1:08:46.86,1:08:51.58,English,,0,0,0,,At the next higher level or a software form of exceptional control flow called a signal
Dialogue: 0,1:08:52.48,1:08:54.54,English,,0,0,0,,So this exists solely on the Linux kernel
Dialogue: 0,1:08:55.18,1:09:00.78,English,,0,0,0,,And then and then even at a higher level at there's an application C language
Dialogue: 0,1:09:01.06,1:09:04.70,English,,0,0,0,, version of exceptional control flow call set jump and long jump
Dialogue: 0,1:09:05.56,1:09:09.40,English,,0,0,0,,so this this notion of exceptional control flow kind of exists
Dialogue: 0,1:09:09.56,1:09:11.84,English,,0,0,0,,in all parts of the system we covered all at once
Dialogue: 0,1:09:13.28,1:09:21.34,English,,0,0,0,,And the lab that we use  to sort of exercise all these ideas is called the shell lab
Dialogue: 0,1:09:21.78,1:09:25.92,English,,0,0,0,,In the shell lab you'll write your own linux shell which is really cool
Dialogue: 0,1:09:25.92,1:09:31.72,English,,0,0,0,,So that's the program the command line program that you interact with whenever you login a Linux box
Dialogue: 0,1:09:32.48,1:09:33.56,English,,0,0,0,,You're going to write your own
Dialogue: 0,1:09:36.46,1:09:41.56,English,,0,0,0,,I don't look for me that was really exciting when I could like write something that looked like a real shell
Dialogue: 0,1:09:41.72,1:09:42.56,English,,0,0,0,,It was pretty
Dialogue: 0,1:09:45.54,1:09:49.98,English,,0,0,0,,The next area is well study is called virtual memory
Dialogue: 0,1:09:50.86,1:09:54.50,English,,0,0,0,, Virtual memory is a sort of combination of hardware and software
Dialogue: 0,1:09:54.98,1:10:01.26,English,,0,0,0,,That presents an abstraction to you of this very of memory is a very large array of bytes
Dialogue: 0,1:10:03.22,1:10:09.00,English,,0,0,0,,When in reality memory is a hierarchy of hardware and of cache memories and DRAMs
Dialogue: 0,1:10:09.54,1:10:15.24,English,,0,0,0,,Virtual memory provides a very high-level abstraction as just a linear sequence of bytes
Dialogue: 0,1:10:15.96,1:10:20.02,English,,0,0,0,,It also does provide a lot of a lot of other useful abstractions
Dialogue: 0,1:10:20.02,1:10:24.16,English,,0,0,0,,That make many different parts of the system much easier to manage
Dialogue: 0,1:10:24.64,1:10:29.62,English,,0,0,0,,Ok so we'll learn will learn about virtual memory,we'll learn how it works
Dialogue: 0,1:10:30.36,1:10:35.22,English,,0,0,0,,We'll learn about the performance impact potential performance impact that has on your programs
Dialogue: 0,1:10:36.54,1:10:42.80,English,,0,0,0,,And we'll also learn how to manage that large pool of memory that it makes available to you
Dialogue: 0,1:10:43.24,1:10:47.88,English,,0,0,0,,And the lab that we do that the lab where you'll do that is called malloclab
Dialogue: 0,1:10:48.46,1:10:52.64,English,,0,0,0,, And in the malloclab you'll write your own malloc and free functions
Dialogue: 0,1:10:53.98,1:10:58.08,English,,0,0,0,,You'll reimplementation ality of the Lipsy malloc and free
Dialogue: 0,1:10:59.14,1:11:00.18,English,,0,0,0,,And this is a...
Dialogue: 0,1:11:02.82,1:11:05.94,English,,0,0,0,,Maybe a maybe it's two pages of code
Dialogue: 0,1:11:06.88,1:11:14.20,English,,0,0,0,,But it'll be a guarantee it'll be the most sophisticated difficult two pages of code you've written
Dialogue: 0,1:11:15.60,1:11:20.08,English,,0,0,0,,Not only because since it's managing the memory system you can't use all of
Dialogue: 0,1:11:20.80,1:11:28.14,English,,0,0,0,,I mean C doesn't have many C doesn't help you out a lot with abstractions for data structures
Dialogue: 0,1:11:28.64,1:11:34.02,English,,0,0,0,,But when you're writing but at least it does give you ideas like struct unions
Dialogue: 0,1:11:34.28,1:11:36.54,English,,0,0,0,,You can use to structure your memory
Dialogue: 0,1:11:37.22,1:11:39.36,English,,0,0,0,,When you're writing a malloc package you can't use any of those
Dialogue: 0,1:11:40.18,1:11:43.46,English,,0,0,0,, You have to write exclusively on pointers and casting
Dialogue: 0,1:11:43.84,1:11:47.46,English,,0,0,0,,Because you malloc package is working at such a low level
Dialogue: 0,1:11:49.30,1:11:54.28,English,,0,0,0,,So it's a very difficult piece of code for that reason
Dialogue: 0,1:11:54.28,1:11:57.12,English,,0,0,0,,But also the design space for malloc is is enormous
Dialogue: 0,1:11:57.64,1:12:00.98,English,,0,0,0,,You have many options they all have implications
Dialogue: 0,1:12:01.26,1:12:05.18,English,,0,0,0,,That trade-off performance and memory efficiency
Dialogue: 0,1:12:08.50,1:12:10.74,English,,0,0,0,,And finally in the last part of the course
Dialogue: 0,1:12:12.66,1:12:15.56,English,,0,0,0,,We deal with I/O input/output
Dialogue: 0,1:12:15.56,1:12:21.02,English,,0,0,0,,Do far in the course we've just talked about sort of running programs on machines
Dialogue: 0,1:12:21.34,1:12:28.08,English,,0,0,0,,In the last part of the course we'll talk about input and output  sending data into and out of the machine
Dialogue: 0,1:12:29.06,1:12:31.54,English,,0,0,0,,So we'll look at basic concepts of Linux I/O
Dialogue: 0,1:12:34.88,1:12:38.58,English,,0,0,0,,And since I think the most interesting form of I/O is networking
Dialogue: 0,1:12:38.58,1:12:43.34,English,,0,0,0,,Which allows you to talk to machines anywhere in the world using the internet
Dialogue: 0,1:12:43.94,1:12:46.60,English,,0,0,0,,We'll also talk we'll learn how to do network programming
Dialogue: 0,1:12:46.60,1:12:51.36,English,,0,0,0,,You'll learn how to write programs that use the sockets interface
Dialogue: 0,1:12:53.14,1:12:59.40,English,,0,0,0,, Which is the basic interface for the internet to talk to machines any potentially any machine in the world
Dialogue: 0,1:13:00.32,1:13:01.80,English,,0,0,0,, And that's really exciting
Dialogue: 0,1:13:01.80,1:13:08.24,English,,0,0,0,,I mean once I can still remember when developing this course I had two windows open on my machine
Dialogue: 0,1:13:08.68,1:13:10.98,English,,0,0,0,,I was SSH into two different machines
Dialogue: 0,1:13:10.98,1:13:15.84,English,,0,0,0,,And I wrote a program to send a message like 'hello world' from one machine to the other
Dialogue: 0,1:13:15.86,1:13:20.46,English,,0,0,0,,And when that hello world appeared on the second windows like so exciting
Dialogue: 0,1:13:21.26,1:13:23.04,English,,0,0,0,, I mean if you're a nerd it's really exciting
Dialogue: 0,1:13:26.02,1:13:30.20,English,,0,0,0,,But just the thought that that could have been at any machine right
Dialogue: 0,1:13:30.76,1:13:34.56,English,,0,0,0,, That could have been any machine that is just like opens up a whole new world
Dialogue: 0,1:13:40.00,1:13:45.08,English,,0,0,0,,okay all of our all of our hand-ins are using a system called auto lab
Dialogue: 0,1:13:45.46,1:13:49.44,English,,0,0,0,,Which was developed here and you can access it
Dialogue: 0,1:13:49.44,1:13:55.50,English,,0,0,0,,If you were on the roster as of this morning if you go to the auto lab link
Dialogue: 0,1:13:55.80,1:13:58.52,English,,0,0,0,,Then you'll see this course listed on your page
Dialogue: 0,1:13:58.94,1:14:02.84,English,,0,0,0,, If you're not enrolled you won't have an auto lab account
Dialogue: 0,1:14:04.00,1:14:06.24,English,,0,0,0,,And you have to be enrolled to get an auto lab account
Dialogue: 0,1:14:07.96,1:14:11.88,English,,0,0,0,,If you if you want to try to wait it out and wait for people to drop
Dialogue: 0,1:14:12.10,1:14:16.90,English,,0,0,0,,I'll make the first couple of at least the first assignment due available from the course webpage
Dialogue: 0,1:14:17.18,1:14:20.60,English,,0,0,0,,So you can work on it without actually handin to auto lab
Dialogue: 0,1:14:21.06,1:14:22.82,English,,0,0,0,,But at least you can keep going
Dialogue: 0,1:14:27.58,1:14:32.48,English,,0,0,0,, Okay if you are enrolled actually I didn't update this but I updated the auto lab accounts today
Dialogue: 0,1:14:34.38,1:14:37.44,English,,0,0,0,,Now one final thing if you have waitlist questions
Dialogue: 0,1:14:37.84,1:14:41.24,English,,0,0,0,,Please don't don't send email to the staff
Dialogue: 0,1:14:41.24,1:14:42.78,English,,0,0,0,,Because we don't control the waitlist
Dialogue: 0,1:14:45.28,1:14:51.86,English,,0,0,0,,You should contact one of these either Cathy Catherine or Zara depending on which class
Dialogue: 0,1:14:53.54,1:14:57.82,English,,0,0,0,,Okay so that's that welcome again looking forward to a great semester
Dialogue: 0,1:14:57.82,1:14:59.68,English,,0,0,0,,And we'll see you on Thursday
Dialogue: 0,1:14:59.68,1:15:02.39,English,,0,0,0,,[Applause]
